The morning was rendered unpleasant by the wind and dust, and heavy rain fell during the greater portion of the afternoon, causing great discomfort to those engaged in out of door sports. In the morning His Excellency held his customary <em>lev&eacute;e</em> at Government house, at which there was not so large an attendance as is usually the case. At noon a royal salute was fired from the men of war at present in the bay, the customary salute was fired from the Princes Bridge Battery by a detachment of the Emerald Hill Artillery, and <em>feu-de-joie</em> by the volunteers assembled at Fisherman's Bend. The volunteer muster was small, numbering a little over 1,000 men. In the afternoon, a sham fight waa engaged in, but the heavy rain interfered with the movements. At Flemiugton, the Melbourne Hunt Club held a race meeting, which was well attended considering the weather. A 25 mile bicycle race in the Warehousemen's Cricket ground, on the St Kilda road, was closely contested, and resulted in the victory of Mr F. Lister In the evening the various places of amusement were all crowded&quot;</p>

			<br>1881 started with a bang. Offenbach's 'La Fille du Tambour Major' acheived a record breaking run of over one hundred performances at the Opera House. At a time when three weeks was considered a good run this production packed them in for three months. This was a record that was not broken for many years. 1881 saw the first admission of women to the University of Melbourne and State schools started to replace church schools. The Dorcas Street school opened in 1881. The population of greater Melbourne was now 282,947. For more on what was happening in Melbourne during 1881 click on a month below.
