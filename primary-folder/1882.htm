			&quot;News has been received from Creswick that the Australian Gold Mine has been flooded. Forty men were at work when the outburst of water occurred; of these 14 escaped, and 26 are still underground. There is now 40ft of water in the main shaft, and the pumps available are quite inadequate to cope with the task of pumping out the mine. Arrangements are being made for additional pumps and engine power. Faint hopes are entertained, however, that those in the mine will succeed in escaping. The scene at the mouth of the mine when the disaster was made known was most distressing.&quot;</p>

							 &quot;We found the Theatre Royal at be a large, dusty, primitive building, with poor accommodation for the audience, and still more wretched arrangements for the actors behind the scenes. The scenic department, so far as the painting is concerned, was excellent, so was the furniture of the stage; but oh! the disorder, the confusion, and the mess. No expense seemed to be spared but such disorder, besides entailing waste, must engender lack of discipline in other departments.&quot;</p>

			<br>In 1882 J.C. Williamson, Arthur Garner and George Musgrove formed a partnership ("The Triumvirate") controlling the Theatre Royal and Princess Theatre in Melbourne and the Sydney Theatre Royal and Adelaide Theatre Royal. This was instituted in May and this marked the beginning of the mighty Williamson theatre organisation. For over eighty years it was to be the principal purveyor of theatrical entertainment in Australia and New Zealand. The first production by the Triumvirate was Gilbert and Sullivan's 'Patience' which opened at the Theatre Royal on July 1st.

<p class="review"><span class="characterStyle3"><em>"The drama had a long run in Sydney, and the performance was marked by completeness which was to be expected under the circumstances. Miss Navarro is especially well suited to the part of the young French woman, as she is able to give the foreign accent with excitement."</em> (Argus) <br>
<em>"Naturally as French is Miss Navaro's native tongue, she gave to the part all the colouring required to make clear the illusion of a French-woman speaking English with a distinctively French manner. But she did much more than this, she played the character to perfect life."</em> (Australasian)</span>  </p>

<p class="review"><span class="characterStyle3">Critics summed up the performers <em>"Mr. Polk is spoken of as versatile and clever, especially in the quick change of business, whilst Mrs Polk has a flexible and highly cultivated voice, which she uses in the rendition of various songs, quite irrelevant, however, to the piece."</em> </td>  </tr>

<p class="review"><span class="characterStyle3"><em>"Both plot and libretto are very tame.

(Age)<br> "The musical composer, Mr. John Crook, is to be congratulated upon his first appearance here. His merits are that he discovers a good turn for tune and has a rich fancy and a free hand in using the resources of the orchestra. Of the artists who gave effect to this representation we need not say very much, because their individual qualities are by this time very well known."</em> (Argus)</td>  </tr>
