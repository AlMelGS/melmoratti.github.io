&quot;The most terrible mining accident that has occurred in the colony since the Creswick disaster happened tonight at the Ellenborough mine, Eaglehawk, and it has thrown that township into a terrible state of excitement. About half-past six o'clock eight men were working in the stopes above the 720 feet level, securing the ground, when an immense mass of quartz of about fifty tons weight fell. All escaped with slight injuries, save (three men), (one was) jammed against the wall, and it took two hours to rescue him. (The two others) were crushed under the mass, and it is certain their death was immediate. Efforts were made to extricate them, but the work was of great danger and difficult, and was not completed till nearly one o'clock this morning. The mine was surrounded by hundreds of anxious people, and the scene upon the bodies being brought to the surface was very affecting. An inquest will be held tomorrow."

							<p class="bodyText10">
Whether it is on account of the warmer climate I do not know, but certainly the colonists are a more musical people than the English. Of course I do not mean that there are any considerable number of people here who really understand classical music, or who play any instrument or sing really well. On the contrary, as I think I have said in some other connection, there is no part of the world where you hear so much bad music, professional and amateur. But it is also true, that there are few
parts where you hear so much music. Almost every working-man has his
girls taught to strum the piano. Amateur concerts are exceedingly
popular. Most young people think they can sing, and nature has certainly
endowed the young colonials with, on the average, far better and more
numerous voices than she has bestowed on English boys and girls.
Sometimes when you are bored in a drawing-room by bad music and poor
singing, you are inclined to think that the colonial love of music is an
intolerable nuisance. Especially is this the case with me, who have been
constantly interrupted in writing by my neighbour's daughters strumming
the only two tunes they know--and those tunes 'Pinafore,' and 'Madame
Angot.' But if you are out for a walk on a summer's evening, and look
into the windows of working men's cottages, you will see the old folk
after their day's labour gathered round the piano in the sitting-room to
hear their daughters play. I cannot hold with those who think a
working-man's daughter should not learn music. Their reasoning is
illogical--for being able to play the piano is in itself harmless, and
may keep the girl out of mischief. Further, it gives a great deal of
pleasure to her parents and friends, and often to herself as well.

			<br>In 1883 Melbourne had four main auditoriums which were continually busy serving up a host of freshly imported plays, operettas and operas from England and Europe. European imports were in an English translation that had usually been performed successfully in London first. The major theatrical event of 1883 was the first Australian performance of 'The Silver King'. This was an unqualified success. The scenery was described as magnificent with many 'trick' and mechanical changes. So click on a month and check what

				<center><b>POLLARDS OPERA COMPANY</b></center>
The revelations as to what almost amounts to the kidnapping of children by the managers of the Pollard Company, are startling and discredible. It seems that neither the children nor their parents in Melbourne had an idea that they were about to proceed to India, and indeed it was expressly stipulated that they were not to leave the Australian Colonies. There are 14 girls and one boy at present with the troupe under these circumstances, and action is likely to be taken by the Victorian Cabinet.<br>
The following extracts from letters received from the children speak for themselves. One of the girls writes:- "I am very unhappy. They treat me very harsh; not like they used to at all. Whatever you do, don't write and tell them what I am telling you, or else they will make me still more miserable." Another says: "You can't be much more sorry about my being away than I am. I have not had one happy day since i left home - nothing but misery and rows." A third writes in a similar strain: "I am very unhappy. I wish to heaven you would get me home, but how you can I don't know. I am not the only one unhappy; all of us wish to get home." <br>

	to hit the public taste. As Edith Vaughan, the "true woman" of the
	drama, Miss Annie Mayor has comparatively few opportunities of exhibiting her exceptional

				<center><b>DEATH OF MRS ARTHUR GARNER</b></center>
We have to announce, with much regret, the death of Mrs Arthur Garner (known to the public by her professional name of Miss Blanche Stammers) at an early hour on Saturday morning, after an illness of only two days duration. She was taken ill during the performance at the Theatre Royal on Wednesday night, and the symptoms at once assumed a serious character, terminating fatally as above stated, notwithstanding the most assiduous ministrations both medical and otherwise.<br>
Mrs Garner commenced her professional career when a very young child, her father and mother being both connected with the stage, so that before coming to these colonies in 1874, she had a long experience of theatrical life, and had made herself a great favourite in the old country. We believe her first appearance in Victoria was at Sandhurst, and she afterwards joined her husband at the Theatre Royal, where she soon took a leading position, the theatre then being under the management of Messes. Harwood, Stewart and Hennings. subsequently she played both in New South Wales and South Australia, but whenever she came back to Melbourne she was always warmly welcomed. her range of characters was considerable, but her somewhat delicate physique of necessity inclined her to light comedy, in which she achieved many successes.<br>
Mrs. Garner's style of acting was distinguished by much gentleness and refinement. Her long experience made her familiar with every resource of the art to which she had devoted herself, and her gracefulness and her perfect taste in dress would have entitled her to the warmest admiration, even if she had had no other recommendation. But she was fastidiously conscientious, in the interpretation of character, never, under any circumstances, allowing herself to be tempted into any display which was out of the track of legitimate effect.
