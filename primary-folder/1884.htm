&quot;To anyone who is in want of a downright unlucky opera troupe I can honestly recommend the one Miss Emelie Melville took away to India. First, Mrs Farley died on the way to Adelaide. In Ceylon misfortunes fell fast upon them. Scott, and Rigby, choristers, and Perkins, leading violin, died of cholera. Signor Verdi was very ill with the same complaint. Miss Melville was, herself, very ill. Mr C. Van Ghele has become hopelessly insane, and is confined in a mad house, also in India. I should not be surprised if the remainder of the company never came back.&quot; (Scalfax December 8th, 1884)

							<center> <b>HER MAJESTY'S OPERA HOUSE </b></center><br></p>
							<p class="bodyText10">
							Her Majesty's Opera House has been newly and magnificently decorated, and is, without doubt, the prettiest theatre south of the line. The stairway leading to the dress circle has been heavily carpeted, and is lit by  many coloured electric lamps. The crush room is a veritable boudoir, hung with brocaded silk tapestry in old gold and deep azure blue, with a soft velvet carpet underfoot, and where, on the walls, where tapestry is not are valuable artistic works. Four extremely civil and obliging attendants in  full evening dress, wait on your wants. The ladies are carefully looked after, for the old office used by Mr Dunning has been transformed into a ladies' parlour, from which they enter their cloak room, the old, unsightly entrance to which has been removed. The theatre itself has been painted and upholstered with an apparent disregard of expense, and is a marvel of taste and beauty. Rich curtains hang over the windows from elegant cornices, and are draped in artistic forms round the many large pier glasses. Every available space has been utilised for some decorative purpose; even the backs of the rows of seats have decorative patterns running round them. A multitude of many coloured electric lamps shed warm rays of light over all this richness; and the whole makes a <i>coup d'&aelig;il</i> that was absolutely starling from its novelty. The decorations have been designed and carried out by a French artist, whose name I forget, but who deserves the highest praise for his tastefulness and skill. The chairs in the dress circle are upholstered in Genoa velvet; and a rich Brussels carpet has been laid in the stalls. A band of pretty young ladies dressed in an attractive costume show you your seat, hand you a programme and perform all those little offices which the average usher thinks derogatory to his dignity to do. I am told the decorations have cost over &pound;1000, and I can fully believe it.  We shall be out of conceit with our Theatre Royal and Princess now. The contrast between the Opera House of three weeks ago, dirty, uncomfortable, and generally seedy, and the present bright, charming, attractive Her Majesty's Theatre is most striking. So far Messrs Rignold and Allison deserve every dramatic patron's sympathy and support.

			<br>In 1884 Melbourne was fast approaching a population of 350,000. The growth extended outwards and an excellent railway system brought commuters into the city. Special trains were laid on for special events and as theatrical programmes were sometimes twice as long as they are today there was always a mad rush at the end of performance to catch that last train home. Maybe nothing much has changed! This year there were first performances of the comedy 'The Parvenu', by by G.W. Godfrey, the drama 'In the Ranks', by by George Sims and Henry Pettitt, and 'Imprudence', by British playwright Arthur Wing Pinero. So click on a month and check what 
			was happening in Melbourne theatres for the year 1884.

						<td align="left" valign="top" class="bodyText1">Alfred Dampier (1847-1908) was one of the most loved actors of colonial 
				Australia. Alfred was born in London and was engaged at the Theatre Royal, Melbourne, as actor-producer in 1872. From 1886 until his retirement in 1905 he was famous for his stage 
				versions of Australian novels. He even organised a competition for an original 
				Australian play. The winning entry he would then stage. His first love was 
				Shakespeare and often during several of his seasons one of the Bard's works 
				would be produced on the Friday evening only. After a disastrous New Zealand 
				tour in 1893 he was forced to declare himself bankrupt. He returned briefly to 
				his homeland, England, in 1894 to stage his most successful adaptation, 
				'Robbery under Arms'. After a London season the company toured throughout England. His last appearance was in Sydney in 1905.

				'The New Magdalen' was played for the last time, at the Theatre Royal on Saturday with Miss Lewis as Mary Merrick. During the prologue Miss Lewis has a very long and trying speech to make to Grace Roseberry, descriptive of her early life. The gallery did not appreciate this, and noisy expressions of disapproval were soon heard. The disturbance became worse and worse, so much so that Miss Lewis had to come forward and try to calm the disturbers in these words: "May I ask the same attention from an Australian public that I have always received in England and America?" Then she broke down, and tears finished the sentence for her. Mr St Lawrence who was standing in the wing, came on the stage and requested some gentleman to throw "those hounds" out of the gallery. A respectable-looking man, named William Kiddle, was arrested for causing the disturbance, and has probably regretted his effusiveness by this time. It is needless to say that Miss Lewis had the entire sympathy of the audience for the remainder of the evening.</em></em>

						<td align="left" valign="top" class="bodyText1">Actor-manager, George Rignold (1839-1912) was an English man who came to Australia in 1878. After a brief tour of England and America he finally settled in australia in the mid 1880s. Her Majesty's Theatre at Sydney was built for him in 1886 which became his headquarters for nine years. Among his leading parts were Mark Antony in Julius Caesar, Caliban in The Tempest, Falstaff, Bottom, Romeo and Macbeth. He was an excellent producer and he sometimes achieved the almost impossible. His production of 'In the Ranks', by Sims and Oettitt, played for 83 performances in 1887/88 and set a record for a non musical play. His last production was 'Othello' in Sydney in 1899. He died, after an operation, in Sydney.</td>
