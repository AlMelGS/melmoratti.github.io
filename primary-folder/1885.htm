&quot;On Saturday night my wife and myself drove a distance of five miles to see "My Partner" performed at Her Majesty's Opera-house, and I must say that during a period of a quarter of a century's experience of theatre-going in Melbourne, I never saw or heard such a display of ruffianism as was shown by the occupants of the gallery on that occasion. Long before the curtain was raised, pellets of all description were thrown at the people in the stalls; was continued at intervals and culminated in a lemonade bottle being thrown, which struck my wife's shoulder, grazed a gentleman's head, and then broke in pieces on the floor. The ladies entering the dress circle were disgusted at the outrageous attention paid to their personal appearance, and the gross remarks shouted through the house by a hundred leather-lunged scoundrels.  The imitations of cat-calls and other animals made the place such a pandemonium that I do not wonder at Mr. George Rignold asking the miscreants 'not to behave as blackguards.'&quot;<br>

							<center> <b>IMPROVEMENTS AT THE THEATRE ROYAL </b></center><br></p>
							<p class="bodyText10">
							During the week the Theatre Royal has been closed in order that the dress-circle might be entirely re-arranged, and to permit of a general renovation of the interior of the theatre. The work of providing modern moveable seats to take the place of those of the &quot;old arm-chair&quot; pattern was entrusted by the management to the firm of Messrs Mclean Bros and Rigg. Formerly the dress-circle was cut up into several diversions, but the barriers have been entirely swept away, a small brass railing with curtains about the vice-regal box being the only partition now remaining. The chief effect of the alteration is that extra sitting accommodation has been provided for about 60 people. The removal of the row of small boxes on either wing, together with the abolition of the cumbrous barriers, given this part of the house a lighter and more roomy appearance. One of the manager's boxes has been slightly enlarged, and will be converted into private boxes. Instead of the high barrier that formerly enclosed the seats, a light wood-work railing, with ornamental hangings has been erected. The movable seats are according to the latest English and American patterns. The back is of cast-iron scroll, decorated in white and gold and with a centre pad of crimson plush velvet. The folding seat is of the same material and colour, and as each seat in the row is independent of the others, they can be removed if necessary, so that two seats of the ordinary size are converted into a single large one. A good deal of expedition was necessary in getting the seats cast and fitted within the week, and the employes of the firm have been obliged to work night and day to get finished in time for the production of &quot;The Private Secretary&quot; this evening. Sitting accommodation is now available in the circle for 240 people, and during the summer months especially the change in the arrangements is likely to be appreciated. In addition to the dress circle alterations, the proscenium and other parts of the theatre in front of the curtain have been re-decorated, so that regular theatregoers will find a decided change for the better in the appearance of this popular place of amusement.

<p class="review"><span class="characterStyle3">The Argus said &quot;<i>Both Miss Moore and Mr. Williamson took their parts of Kate and Kerry in the first piece, and Arrah and Shaun in the second. It is doubtful whether, in any of the characters they have sustained, they have shown greater ability, or made themselves more popular, than in those named.</i>&quot; </span>  </p>

On the 5th and 6th 'Rip Van Winkle' then 'Kerry' and 'Arrah' on the 7th. The mixed programme continued into the following week.

<p class="review"><span class="characterStyle3">&quot;<i>The central character of the drama and the prime favourite with the spectators is that of the Irish washerwoman, as played by Miss Maggie Moore. The actress succeeded in making the part a thoroughly lovable one, true to nature homely but not vulgar and delightful throughout. Miss Kate Bishop, who made her first appearance at the Theatre Royal on Saturday night, met with an enthusiastic reception, and found a congenial part to represent in that of Helen Standish. She was especially acceptable in the love making scene in the third act; although there is a tendency towards becoming mannered in her acting.</i>&quot; (Argus)<br>
&quot;<i>Commendation deserves to be liberally bestowed upon the scenic artist and the stage manager. The interior of the pawnbroker's shop was most realistic and the view of the New York harbor by moonlight a masterpiece of stage scenery. A view of Harlem River was equally effective.</i>&quot; (Age)</span>  </p>

&quot;<i>In Mr. H.E. Hambro we have a newcomer, who made a favourable impression as Valentine. His representation caught and pleased the eye more than the mind. Mr Rignold did absolute justice to Mephistopheles, or that he fulfilled to the letter one's notions what such a personage should say and do, or how he ought to do it.</i>&quot; (Age)

 The play was elaborately mounted with a full chorus and military band. There were even giant bells, valued at &pound;750, for the Cathedral scene.
