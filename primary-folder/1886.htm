&quot;Another of those painful cases which, in spite of stringent prohibitive  legislation, crop up every now and then, is being investigated by the police. A young girl, Georgina Warburton by name, died on Friday last at 25 Young street, under circumstances which, it is alleged, leave no doubt that a criminal operation had been performed on her. The notorious Mrs Taylor is said to be the guilty person, and is now under arrest. This woman has been accused of malpractice on four different occasions on which her patients have died, but has always managed to escape conviction. Miss Warburton was lately a member of the &quot;Silk Stockings&quot; Company, and was a daughter of the late Mr. Percival Warburton, for many years box-office keeper at the Theatre Royal.&quot;<br>

							This is most undeniably an age of progress. Art and science combined are brought to bear on all things. Steam and electricity annihilate distance. A wise legislation compels even the house-holder to improve 'our dwellings'. Stringent rules of hygiene have reformed all public buildings, schoolhouses, hospital wards; factories have to provide for increased room, adequate light, and efficient ventilation. Yet whilst this progressive movement is going on, there are still in all large centres of population, a number of halls, concert rooms, theatres and other places wherein large crowds congregate together, which are not only totally unfit for such a purpose, but dangerous, in the event of a panic. The watchful eye of the civic authorities or the Board of Health should be cast in that direction in order to compel the proprietors of such buildings to adopt measures for their proper ventilation and provide for easy modes of egress. Progress, however, takes the lead, enterprising men have noticed this crying evil; and there are now in course of construction, in Melbourne, two new theatres which, will, we have no doubt, soon be duly appreciated by a discerning public, whose comfort has been carefully studied by the proprietors. we have, in this city, a large and ever increasing population; a population consisting principally of well-to-do people; learning industrious, hard-working artistans; sufficiently well educated to appreciate good theatrical entertainments. it has all been said, very truly, that the Melbourne public &quot;must have the very best of everything.&quot; Our population-principally middle class-when the day's toil is over, is ever ready to enjoy a night's amusement. The merchant, the tradesman as well as the working man, if tempted by an attractive &quot;bill&quot;, are willing to patronise in large numbers theatres, concerts, fairs, or indeed any well-devised, well-conducted place of amusement. We are indebted, to a great extent, to the able and spectutive firms who of late have catered for the amusement of our people. But we are bound to notice the great lack of suitable places wherein the great gatherings are held, and it is with gratification that we call our readers attention to the new theatres now in course of construction in the city.

			<br>In 1886 there was a sad lack of suitable venues for the growing Melbourne population. There were three main theatres offering the latest from the world's stages. There were also a number of smaller auditoriums offering lighter entertainment from smaller companies and solo artists. Two new theatres were being built but they would not open until the end of the year. Click on a month and check what

					<center><b>A SCENIC ARTIST AT WORK</b></center></a>
				<BR>
				<center><b>Mr. J. BRUNTON</b></center>
				The stage doorkeepers stereotypical answer, &quot;Not here this afternoon&quot;, did not us, for, though our visit was not pre-arranged, we felt confident that the words &quot;representative of THE HERALD&quot; would serve both as introduction to the artist and excuse for interrupting his labours. The Cerberus contented to go and make sure that Mr. Brunton was not in his room, and in a few minutes returned and invited us to to enter. There are no passages at the back of the Theatre Royal stage to bewilder the stranger. The hindermost drop scene hangs a few yards from the street door and a narrow iron stairway in the right hand corner leads straight to the designing room.<br>
As we enter Mr. Brunton lays down not a brush or a palette, but a pair of scissors. The room is as unlike an artist's studio as it is possible to conceive. No half-finished pictures, bits of drapery, properties, casals (?) or any other adjuncts of the profession, not even a blind to tone the light and hide the hideous outlook on to the battered roofs of the Chinese shops in Little Burke street.<br>
&quot;You see&quot;, said Mr. Brunton pointing to a little cardboard model of a act scene, &quot;I have already got to work. This is a scene for the pantomime.&quot; We gazed at it somewhat blankly, perchance, for the artist, with a half smile, explained that the model was all formed to scale, so that the carpenters could build from it. &quot;I don't know whether it can be called realistic, for it is meant to represent the bottom of the ocean&quot;, said Mr, Brunton. Then the splotches of violet color and the spider-like tracery of the slips and flies, resolved themselves into anernones, and seaweed, and corals, and shells of various shape and brilliant color, a grotto such as Clarence dremed of, but which Dr. Carpenter never found in his dredgings.<br>
&quot;I never use foil but trust to painting for brilliant effects&quot;, said Mr. Brunton. &quot;When I first told the manager, at Liverpool, that I would not require tinsel or ballet girls for the transformation scene, he remonstrated, said that the public wouldn't be satisfied without them, and so on. But I kept to my resolution, and for each of the five scenes I presented, the audience insisted on my appearing to receive their applause.&quot;<br>
Mr. Brunton is a diligent student of nature and excels in the portrayal of woodland scenery. Perhaps, by contrast, he has a predilection for making small sketches. But he has at the same time a quite wonderful knack of maintaining proportions. A little landscape, on a few inches of paper, will be so arranged that it will make a most effective scene when enlarged to forty feet by thirty; and his coloring will range from the clear shadows of Constable to the glowing brilliancy of Turner's latter style.<br>
&quot;Yes; I saw the famous scenery for Faust at the Lyceum&quot;, replied Mr. Brunton, in answer to a question about London stage scenery. &quot;It was very finely designed. Everything is subdued, so as to make the actors the central point of attraction on the stage. The scenery is treated as a good artist treats his background in a figure subject - nothing is slurred, and nothing overwhelms in prominence the figures. The singularly powerful impressions of the scenes on the audience is got by careful adjustment of lights. By it all the actors are thrown into prominence in the most natural way. Irving's impersonation is a most masterly one, and the merits of his performance have not been exaggerated by the critics.&quot;<br>
Mr. Brunton, continuing on the subject, expresses strong disapprobation of the practice of revolving scenery and its adjuncts, where apparently for the mere sake of novelty, the ingenious mechanisms of the stage carpenter are laid bare before the audience. What artistic merit is served, or illustration maintained, by twisting a cottage round, so that the hero may scramble out of the top story window; or chairs and tables sliding mysteriously off at the wings, while the side of the room is whipped up above the tree tops? Mary Anderson, with true American disregard for tradition, introduced such scenery when playing Romeo and Juliet at the Lyceum, but the public expressed disapproval so strongly that she gave it up.<br>
&quot;Some of the best scenery I saw in London just before I left&quot;, continued Mr. Brunton, &quot;was in Harbor Lights, at the Adelphi. The moonlight effects were very beautiful.&quot;<br>
Reverting to the question of the present state of art in England, Mr. Brunton remarked that the standard of average painting had greatly risen within the last ten years. Students, however, still have to flounder on in the old way, pointing most things out for themselves; but the old principle of model drawing and still life study is almost abandoned in favor of life studies and open-air sketching. &quot;Good pictures are saleable enough, not withstanding the dulness of the trade generally; but they must be good; mediocre productions are a drag.&quot;<br>
Mr. Brunton, when at Liverpool, had a good reputation as a landscape painter, and a collection of his works exhibited at Agnew's attracted a good deal of attention amongst art patrons. It was not many days after his arrival in Victoria, however, before he was told that there was very little prospect of a landscape artist finding purchasers amongst the wealthy &quot;wool kings&quot;.  &quot;There are lots of people here who can perfectly appreciate good work&quot;, said these Job's comforters, &quot;but there are precious few who will pay for them.&quot;<br>
Mr. Brunton, however, notwithstanding his eight years' service as the principal of a large theatre, is still young, and has the hopefulness of youth and the capacity for hard work which is akin to genius. It was speaking of the time occupied in designing and painting the sets for a Shakespearian play, four of which Mr. Brunton has prepared, that we suddenly recollected the days were short, and we had chatted away much valuable daylight; so we stood not on the order of our going but went. <br>
