&quot;On Saturday, Sunday and Monday it has rained with a persistency which gladdens the heart of the farmer, and brings language not loud but deep to the unfortunate who live in cities, and only judge rain by the mud it makes. All our reservoirs are full to overflowing, and we were looking forward to a cessation of the annual water famine; but we are now cherrfully told that, although there is more than sufficient water, there are no pipes to convey it to the city. We are a curious people, we are.&quot; (Scalfax October 11, 1887)

							<p class="bodyText10">
								There was a crowded assemblage at the opening of the new Princess's Theatre on Saturday evening, every seat being occupied in all parts of the spacious building. The short space of only eight months has elapsed since the theatre was commenced from original designs furnished by Mr. George Gordan, who also supplied the artistic decorations, Mr. William Pitt being the architect. Both these gentlemen were called before the curtain during the course of the evening and were honored with a most attractive reception. One novel feature among the decorations is two handsome paintings on each side of the proscenium, which during the intervals are withdrawn, showing a picturesque arrangement of ferns and rockwork, a miniature cascade trickling down the latter with deliciously cool and refreshing effect. An important feature is that the stage can be seen perfectly from any part of the theatre, owing to the shape of the auditorium and the sloped arrangements of seats throughout the house giving those at the back as good a view as those in front. The place reserved for the orchestra is exactly what it should be, and may be considered a model for imitation; and the acoustic properties of the theatre are everything that could be desired. The enterprise and appreciation of artistic requirements shown by Messrs. Williamson, Garner and Musgrove in the erection of this uniquely beautiful theatre cannot be too highly praised. It is a revelation of artistic possibilities, of luxury and loveliness, in which everything is complete, even to the smallest detail, and forms a <i>tout ensemble</i> having hardly any equal in the world. 	It might be aptly termed, like the &quot;stately pleasure dome&quot; in Coleridge's Kubla Khan, &quot;a miracle of rare device,&quot; such rich and varied imagination does it exhibit in design and such artistic skill in execution.

		<p class="bodyText1">
			<br>Melbourne now had five major theatres. The theatre-going public never had it so good. Each of these theatres were modern sophisticated halls of entertainment and throughout 1887 artists and companies would make the long journey to Australia from Europe and America. The Brough and Boucicault Company played the Opera House most of the year before transferring to the Bijou. They continued to mount the latest attractions from the London stage. 1887 was Jubilee year and the celebrations fell in mid June. Thousands of pounds were spent on the illuminations and the city hotels and theatres enjoyed great business. In July the Royal Comic Opera Company mounted the first production in Australia of Gilbert and Sullivan's 'Princess Ida'. This proved very successful with Australian audiences and achieved a long run. Martin Simonsen's Royal Italian Opera Company played an unprecedented three seasons during the course of the year. More opera in 1887 than today! So click on a month and check what 
			was happening in Melbourne theatres for the year 1887. All reviews are from

</p>
<p class="review"><span class="characterStyle3">The Age said of 'Billie Taylor': &quot;<i>An old ballad was hunted up and a story constructed out of it, but in the treatment the wish to emulate (Gilbert and Sullivan), though occasionally perceptible, is diversified by excursions into the domain of components of the French opera bouffee school</i>&quot;</span>  </p>
