&quot;A man named Francis Pinder had an unpleasant surprise at the Princess Theatre, Sandhurst, on May 8 last. He was witnessing the performance of the Garetta and Ouda Company from the gallery, and during a trapeze act a pistol was  fired, the wad from which penetrated his hat and set it on fire on his head. He claimed a new hat from the management, who refused the supply, alleging they did not pay for anything not skin deep.

							&quot;<i>Dear Sir,<br>
								Two years ago when I was married I was only a girl, unversed in the world's 
								ways, full of love for my husband, but wanting in that wisdom which is only 
								bought by bitter experience. Through the scandal of neighbours into our life 
								came 'the little rift within the lute', and finally we drifted apart. One word 
								would have explained all, but pride prevented its utterance. I returned to my 
								mother, and day by day watched him as he passed my window on his way to the 
								office, hoping against hope that he would return to me. This wretched existence 
								went on until last Wednesday, when, by chance, reading the words written by the 
								English clergyman on 'THE WORLD AGAINST HER', something impelled me to go to 
								its performance. During the progress of the play I was so carried away by the 
								Pathetic story that I had my eyes and ears for nothing else, and in the 
								intermission I was haunted by the one thought - 'IF HARRY COULD ONLY SEE THIS 
								PLAY'. At last the curtain fell on the perfect picture of confidence restored 
								and domestic happiness assured, and then across the theatre, I saw my husband. 
								As i was hurrying out, a hand slid into mine, and the voice I knew and loved so 
								well, said, 'EMILY, FORGET and FORGIVE'.
								<br>
								'THE WORLD AGAINST HER' has brought such happiness to me that I trust all women 
								who suffer or have suffered will, as you suggested in your advertisement, bring 
								their Sweethearts, Husbands, Sons and Daughters to learn the lesson it teaches. 
								Harry knows I am writing this and approves.<br>
								Yours, gratefully, ---&quot;</i>

This was originally a novel published in 1856 and turned into a dramatisation 
in 1865. A serious drama describing the cruelties of prison discipline. The 
play ran until the 22nd after which the Warner Company headed for Sydney. The 
theatre then went into final rehearsals for the annual pantomime which, as by 
custom, opened on Boxing day. 				</p>

				Ida Osborne, Sophie Harris, Florence Harcourt, Clara Thompson and other popular
