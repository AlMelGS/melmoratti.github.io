&quot;The rebuilding of the Bijou Theatre was being rapidly carried on, and that the foundations were all down. The plans of the new building were submitted to the Board of Health on Thursday, and to the surprise of everyone were rejected on the ground that the theatre was not on the ground but over an arcade, and that the escapes were into a narrow street. The plans were accepted by the board's inspector, the official referees, and the professional element, but were rejected by the non-professional branch. Mr Wilson considers he has been very badly treated, as he has already spent a good deal of money over the rebuilding, which is now wasted. The matter will probably be settled in the Supreme Court. It is contended that the board has no power to adjudicate on the site of the theatre.&quot;

		Mr. J.C. Williamson has received news of Mr. Arthur Garner's departure from London. The projected trip through America has been abandoned, all the necessary engagements having been made in England, and Mr. Arthur Garner will accordingly return by the P. and O. route, travelling overland to Brindisi. The Triumvirate has always been noted for completeness with which they stage comic opera, and in order to maintain the high level of the former years, several new artists and three new works have  been secured. Dorris, Mr. Cellier's new opera, now succeeding Dorothy at the Lyric Theatre, has been purchased, and so has Paul Jones, which has already been running some four or five months at the Prince of Wales Theatre. La Gironette, a comic opera which lately made its trial trip at Portsmouth, has also, Mr. Williamson believes, been purchased, though he has received no cablegram on the subject as yet. The new engagements are Miss Helen Kinnaird, contralto, from the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, and Miss Clara Merivale of that ilk; whilst Messrs. Sass and George Walton and Miss Gwynne are invoiced to arrive shortly to strengthen the comedy department. Mr. Garner has also been negotiating with Mrs. Langtry and Miss Mary Anderson, and a successful issue is anticipated in both cases. Two complete companies of specialty artistes are under contact to land in time for next year's pantomimes. Mr. Garner has, since his departure from Australia, laid upwards of &pound;10,000 in the purchase of plays and engagement of actors, and Mr. Williamson expects to have a busy year before him. </p>

The season of operas that ran all December continued without a break into January. There were further productions of 'Un Ballo in Mascha', 'Ernani', and finally 'Maritana'. Suddenly the season came to an abrupt termination on January 5th. The theatre manager, Martin Simonsen, in a letter to the press explained that he could not control the people he engaged. The company uprooted and headed for Sydney. [Editor's note: At this point we should point out that Signor Verdi, and his wife Emelie Melville, departed for England (via South Africa). They later moved to America and settled down in California. However Emelie Melville couldn't resist the theatrical urge. The couple split with Emelie returning to Australia to tour twice in the late 1890s. Emelie (or Emilie as she was known at that time) first visited Australia in 1875 making her debut in Sydney in 'Girofle-Girofia'. The peak of her popularity was during the 1880s. She spent the last years of her life living in San Francisco.] </p>
