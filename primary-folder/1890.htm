&quot;Theatrical matters in Brisbane are in a poor state. The D'Arcy Stanford Pantomime Company has collapsed, and the other two theatres are being kept open by weak variety companies. As most of the country inland is covered with water, travelling is impossible, and companies are anchored at whatever towns they happened to be when the water rose, and are praying for dry weather, that is, those who know how to pray.&quot; (Scalfax February 24th, 1890)

		For eleven continuous years, Mr. Sheridan has been playing the Widow O'Brien, his record of actual representations during that period closely approaching three thousand times, so that his name has become inseparable from his performance. Mr. Sheridan, like every other actor, who possesses the skill and experience to think out a part, commenced on the lowest rung of the theatrical ladder, with a very small part and a very small salary, and in his twenty-six years association with the stage, has had as thorough a training as any actor in Australia.<br> Mr. John Francis Sheridan, was born in Providence, Rhode Island, United States, on October 7, 1848, and as he was originally intended to be an engineer, he passed some months in a foundry, so as to gain practical training of his future calling. The work, However, proving distasteful, the lad went on the stage, making his first appearance on April 12, 1864, at the Theatre Royal, Pawtackett, Rhode Island, in  a part that could not be said to tax his memory too heavily as the sole dialogue consisted of two &quot;Yes, sir's&quot; and one &quot;No, sir&quot;, he had to encounter the usual struggles and strivings of a beginner, but in the end found his footing secure, although not till several years had been spent in very hard work. From 1870 his lucky star commenced to rise, and he became known as a comedian who might be relied on to get a good effect out of every character he presented. <br>In 1878 it was the fashion among the smaller theatres of New York to conclude the entertainment with a farce, and in one of these Mr. Sheridan happened to be representing the character of an elderly Irish widow, whose two daughters had gone crazy over Pinafore, and who were in consequence ordered off to a lunatic asylum. The action passed on board the &quot;Bristol&quot;, a magnificently appointed steamboat that plied at that time between New York and Boston. <br>Mr. Sheridan's performance created so much amusement that it occurred to him it would be a good idea to work out a three-act comedy on the same lines. Conferring with Mr. George Fawcett Rowe, an actor and dramatists in America, but who had previously won fame in Australia, Mr. Sheridan gave a sketch of the piece, and placed the construction in Mr. Rowe's hands, reserving the Widow O'Brien for his own invention, with the result that the play now known all over the world as Fun on the Bristol, was evolved. The first performance was given at the Newport Theatre, Rhode Island, in 1879, and the success it then achieved has followed it ever since.  </p>

Theatre in Melbourne in 1890 was booming leaving little indication of what would follow the following year. Long runs were the norm. The New Bijou opened its doors in April under the management of the Brough-Boucicault company. Nellie Stewart headed her own company at the Opera House that same month and there were long seasons by the Bland Holt company, J.F. Sheridan, the Simonsen Opera Company and the J.C. Williamson operetta company. Click on a month and check what was happening in Melbourne theatres for the year 1890. All reviews are from 'Table Talk' unless otherwise stated.</font>

"<em>ln the hands of an actress of genius, the character of Mdlle de Bressier is one of which an immense deal might be made. But Mrs Potter only indicates the possibilities of the part instead of translating them into accomplished facts. She looks the character to perfection, and her costumes are everything that could he desired. When this is said, all is said. She never gets inside her characters, and her defective methods of reading, the monotonous rising and falling inflection of her voice in almost every sentence she utters, the jerkiness of her delivery, and the absence of all real passion and its inadequate simulation when strong emotion has to be expressed, render eulogy impossible.</em>" (Argus)

&quot;<i>Mrs Potter, as in everything else she does, has made a careful study of Hero, and acts with sensitive feeling and tenderness.</i>&quot; (Table Talk)<br> As usual Scalfax was more sarcastic...&quot;<i>If Hero would throw in a sand jig to liven up the somberness of Act II, and Leander oblige the company with a comic song, we might not object to pay full prices for a two hours' show, close upon an hour of which is made up of intervals.</i>&quot;</span>

&quot;<em>Mr Martin Simonsen's Italian Opera season at the Royal is a decided failure. 'The Bohemian Girl' has attracted a very small portion of the public, and that portion is not very well pleased. In fact, some of it says rude things. This opera was announced for final performance on Friday, and on Saturday we were to be electrified with 'Martha', but Signor Buzzi, who was to appear as Plunket, had a cold, fell off a tram, or met with some other misfortune, and could not attend. Mr Simonsen made the necessary apologies, and announced that 'The Bohemian Girl' would be specially revived. Then the audience got up and howled, and used bad words, and likewise wanted its money returned, but therein it did not know the manager. Tonight, 'Maritana' will endeavour to rope in a payable audience, with Miss Elsa May as the young lady who 'hears it again', and Mr Jules Simonsen as the very weak-kneed representative of the roysterer who is not at all particular whom he marries. Tomorrow, Mr Simonsen the elder takes the usual benefit. As the speculation is entirely Mr Simonsen's and he gets all the profits, we fail to see why he should have a benefit. But perhaps there were no profits. It's quite likely.</em>&quot;
