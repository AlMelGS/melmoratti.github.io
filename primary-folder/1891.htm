&quot;Mr. James MacMahon, of the theatrical firm of MacMahon brothers, of the Melbourne Opera House, has just returned to melbourne after his trip to America, where he purchased a number of new pieces and effected several important engagements for Australia. The visit has not been wholly one of pleasure, althoug every facility for enjoyment was provided wherever Messrs. James and Joseph MacMahon went. In San Francisco they did not remain long as the standard of entertainment was found to be so much lower than Australia.&quot;</p>

		An examination in the bankruptcy of Mrs. C.K. M. Mayer, operatic singer, known professionally as Miss Clara Merivale, was held before Judge Worthington, in the Melbourne Insolvency Court on Monday and Tuesday, August 24 and 25. Mrs. Mayer said that on March 28 she entered into an agreement with Charles and James MacMahon to produce operas at Her Majesty's Opera House, Bourke-street. The rent of the theatre, of which Messrs. MacMahon were the lessees, was &pound;120 a week. Falka was the first opera produced. The weekly salaries paid to the principals were - Miss Merivale (insolvent), &pound;10; Mr. Snazelle, &pound;30; Mr. Goulay, &pound;22 10s; Mr. Ford &pound;12; Miss Liddiard, &pound;20; Miss Salvini, &pound;8; Mr. Knight Aston, &pound;20; Mr. Wallace, &pound;15; Mr. Harris (the conductor) and Mrs. Harris (Miss Aggie Kelton), &pound;20; Mr. Woodfield (as a retainer, he not playing), &pound;15. The salaries for the male chorus came to &pound;53 15s, all receiving &pound;3 each. The members of the orchestra received from &pound;6 to &pound;3 a week the total being &pound;66 10s. The female chorus totalled &pound;45 15s, salaries ranging from &pound;2 10s to &pound;1 and the ballet cost &pound;18. The total expenses for the first week were &pound;1336 1s 4d, and the receipts &pound;1269 18s; for the second week receipts were &pound;849 2s 7d; the third week receipts were &pound;507 16s 6d, expenses &pound;749 5s 3d; and the fourth week receipts were &pound;485 19s 6d, and expenses &pound;792 13s 9d. Insolvent was to receive 60 per cent of the gross receipts up to &pound;1,000, and 70 per cent on all takings over that sum. When the opera of Poor Jonathan was produced Mr. Snazelle received &pound;30 per week. Mr. Lenmane &pound;21 and Mr. Hamilton Clarke for conducting &pound;20 per week. The right to produce Falka was hired from Mr. George Rignold at &pound;40 per week. A retaining fee of &pound;125 was paid for the operas of Poor Jonathan and the Gipsy baron. Charles McMahon, examined, said his firm paid &pound;100 per week rent for the theatre and &pound;20 per week for electric lighting. The orchestra ordinarily cost &pound;40 to &pound;50, but a manager always had to pay the members more when they played in opera. Players in the theatrical orchestra belonged to a union which regulated the rates of payment. After evidence in detail of the business relations between Messrs. MacMahon and insolvent, the examination closed. </p>
