&quot;I notice by reports in the Melbourne papers that during Madame Bernhardt's season in the Southern capital it was the custom of the ladies who patronised tho stalls to remove their hats during the performance. This was not done, as some might suppose, as a mark of reverence to a great artiste, but to enable people who had the misfortune to have back seats to see the acting. Will the ladies of Sydney kindly extend their clemency in like manner? It is to be sincerely hoped they will.&quot;</p>

		The new theatre which has lately been erected in Castlereagh-street, on the site formerly occupied by the Academy of Music, was thrown open last evening to a number of prominent patrons of the drama, and other gentlemen interested in the well-being of the stage and the theatrical profession. This, the latest addition to the homes of amusement, provided for the residents of Sydney and surroundings, has been named the &quot;Garrick&quot;, and should, in the hands of its present management and by virtue of the facilities afforded for the production of the plays which may from time to time be placed upon its stage, be able to enlist a large share of support from the public. The building proper has a frontage of 66 feet to Castlereagh-street, with an average depth of 180ft. The forward portion consists of an hotel, with a bar on the ground floor and the usual adjuncts. It gives also the various entrances to the theatre, each of the three provided being 8ft wide. The size of the auditorium of the theatre is 45ft x 65ft. It is divided into sections to be known as the stalls, orchestra chairs, dress circle, family circle, and private boxes. Of the stalls and orchestra chairs there are in all  about 450; there are 165 seats in the dress circle, 350 persons can be accommodated in the family circle, and the boxes are four in number, so that there is accommodation for close upon 1000 individuals. The dress circle is reached by a flight of marble steps 8ft in width; all the other stairs are constructed  of iron between bricks walls, with hardwood facings and landings of concrete laid with tiles. It is considered, therefore, by the architect that in this particular the building is as proof against fire as it well can be.  The stage measures 45ft x 50ft, and there is a property-room of the same dimensions underneath. The dressing-rooms, of which there are six small and two large, are at the rear, and a capacious scene-dock is about to be built.  The ceiling of the auditorium is dome-shaped. For the comfort of visitors this theatre has been fitted with a sliding roof 10ft in diameter, which can easily be manipulated by one man. The flooring rests upon a solid concrete bass. As regards the orchestra, a speciality has been introduced. It has been built a few feet below the front of the orchestra chairs. The audience will, accordingly, look over the heads of the musicians without any difficulty whatever. The stalls are placed upon a rather a steep incline, which is a feature altogether in favour of visitors, and, while a really good view of the stage can be obtained from this quarter, the same may be said with respect to all other parts of the house. In the family-circle, which is next above the dress-circle, and, in fact, the only tier over it, the stage can be seen even from the corners adjourning the proscenium. The inner dimensions of the proscenium are 25ft x 25ft. This part of the building is of brick construction,a nd the decorated portions are  formed of pressed zinc, which are picked out in blue and gold. The brick wall is carried several feet into the ground, and also some distance above the ceiling, as a safeguard against the extension of fire in case of an outbreak arising. The private boxes are embellished in light tints and gold, as also are the facings of the circles. Orange and blue predominate in the drapings of the boxes, and these colours are found to harmonise well with the general surroundings. Upon the ceiling are paintings of appropriate subjects by Signor Lorenzini. The dress circle and stalls are seated with comfortable opera chairs of American manufacture. A deep red is the colour of the upholstering. Leading from the dress circle are various rooms for the convenience of ladies and a smoking-room for gentlemen. The curtain is a satin-faced woolen material of fine texture, and a rather bright-red hue. An act-drop, representing Lago D'Orta, Italy, has been specially painted for the theatre by Mr. W.J. Wilson, who has skilfully and artistically portrayed his subject. It has been much admired by those who have seen it. The system of lighting which will be relied upon is Edison's principle of installation with incandescent electric lamps, of which about 250 have been placed in position. Where there are clusters, the brackets used are of floral design. Accidents have been guarded against by the laying on of gas through the building. The theatre is to be opened with an adaptation of Ouida's novel &quot;Moths&quot; on Monday next.</p>

		Whereas theatre in Melbourne started to suffer during 1891 Sydney Theatre seemed to continue to flourish. There were still a few signs of struggle with some very short seasons and a few abrupt closures but generally people still managed to get out for an evening of entertainment. There were a few Australian firsts during 1891: Jerome K. Jerome's drama 'Barbara', the comedy 'Sunlight and Shadow' by Richard Carton and the farcical comedy by William Lestocq and Walter Everard entitled 'Uncles and Aunts'.

<p class="review"><span class="characterStyle3">&quot;<i>Mr. Toole's embodiment of the character of the busy-body, so closely sketched by John Poole in 1825, is one of the most perfect in the whole range of Mr. Toole's long list of comic characters.</i>&quot;</span></p>

<p class="review"><span class="characterStyle3">&quot;<i>The piece went wonderfully well, and that it did so is due to three factors in the ensemble - judicious, compression, handsome staging, and the forcible acting of the two principals.</i>&quot; </span></p>
<p class="bodyText1">On Saturday September 5th the comedy drama 'The Ambassador' was mounted for the first time in Australia. This was an adaptation, by F.C. Phillips and Sydney Grundy, from Phillips' own novel 'The Daughter of the Dream'. </p>
<p class="review"><span class="characterStyle3">&quot;<i>Of Mr. Cartwright's impersonation of the impossible Dean, it may be said that it left little or nothing to be desired as a character study...Mr. Cartwright's Dean, with his dun-dodging, his stimulants, and his intervals of meditation, is a most undignified dignitary.</i>&quot; </span></p>
<p class="bodyText1">The last night was on September 11th. On Saturday 12th 'The Middleman' was revived for three nights only. This was followed by 'The Profligate', 'A Scrap of Paper' and 'The Idler'. On Saturday 19th there was another Australian first. This was 'A Village  Priest' by Sydney Grundy. [Editor's note: This was an adaptation of 'La Secret de la Terreuse', a melodrama by William Busnach and Jean-Pierre Cauvin] </p>
<p class="review"><span class="characterStyle3">&quot;<i>This is a good play, excellent all-round acting, and a cast including some staunch popular favourites, and it need scarcely be said that the first production took place under the most gratifying circumstances.</i>&quot; </span></p>
<p class="bodyText1">The last night of the Cartwright-Nethersole season in Australia was on Friday September 25th. The two leading artists of the company then went their seperate ways but both eventually returned to England.<br>
On Saturday 26th there was a farewell season by popular Australian actor and author George Darrell. Opening this season was Darrell's own 'The Sundowner'. </p>
<p class="review"><span class="characterStyle3">Reviews were lukewarm saying that the work was &quot;<i>merely commonplace, and to say that is to say everything that need be said. Mr. Darrell has not only staged his drama well, but, as such pieces go, it is by no means ill-acted.</i>&quot; </span></p>

<p class="review"><span class="characterStyle3">&quot;<em>The new cast proved, on the whole, a strong one; though in a work of this kind one feels that the Royal Comic Opera Company sustains a serious loss in the absence of Miss nellie Stewart...the chief feature in the new cast is Mr. Charles Ryley's Strephon, which is the best yet seen in Sydney.</em>&quot;</span></p>
<p class="bodyText1"> The afterpiece of the evening was the popular 'Charity Begins at Home'. The last night was the 12th after which the company headed for Adelaide.<br>
On Monday September 14th the London Gaiety Company returned to Sydney after an absense of three years. First up was 'Ruy Blas and the Blase Roue', by A.C. Torr and Herbert F. Clark with music by Meyer Lutz. This had first been performed in London in September 1889. The Sydney cast featured Fred Leslie, Grace Pedley, Sylvia Grey, Florence Levey and, of course, Nellie Farren </p>

<p class="review"><span class="characterStyle3">&quot;<i>The effect produced by the play is that of clever artifice, and the heart is rarely touched.

Stephenson, 1838 � 1906] </p>

Pollard's Liliputian Opera Company began its first New Zealand tour in 1881 opening with <i>H.M.S. Pinafore</i>.
