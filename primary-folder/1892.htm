<center><b>THE ITALIAN OPERA COMPANY</b></center></p>
	<p class="bodyText10">
		 The attendance at the Promenade Concert given at the Exhibition building on Saturday evening was unprecedentedly large. All the available space within the concert hall was occupied, the audience taking possession of even the organ gallery. The attraction was the appearance of the Italian artists who have recently been performing at the Princes's Theatre. While appearing at the Princess's the company  were indifferently successful from a financial point of view, and the fact that several thousands of people assembled to hear them when they could do so at small expense may be taken as a sign of the times. The mass of the people are apparently disinclined or unable at the present period to pay the regular theatre rates for their amusement. The programme on the whole was of a most acceptable character, and recalls were the rule throughout the evening. The principal feature was Signora Cuttica's admirable performance of the favourite polacca from the opera 'Mignon'. It was artistic in the highest degree, and just what was to have been expected from one who has given the utmost satisfaction in many operatic <i>r&ocirc;les.</i>At the conclusion of the polacca Signora Cuttica was applauded with such enthusiasm that an encore had to be complied with. Signora Cuttica, with her husband, also gave the principal duet from 'Carmen', and took the part in quartets from 'Rigoletto' and 'Martha', each of these numbers creating a very favourable impression. 	<br>

		<p class="bodyText1">
		1892 was quite a terrible year for theatre in Melbourne. Companies folded almost overnight and it was with great difficulty that managers were able to even hire out the theatres let alone yet alone fill them with audiences. It was a very lean year indeed and at one point it looked like there might not even be a single theatre open in the city. However it was certainly a year of theatrical firsts. Melbourne played host to first Australian performances of several popular London productions including 'Dead Beat' (George Conquest), 'The Grey Mare' (George Sims), 'Walker, London' (J.M. Barrie), 'The Hobey Horse' (Pinero) and 'Gloriana' (adapt Mortimer). 1892 was also the year of the  'Ta-Ra-Ra-Boom-der-ay' craze.</p>

In 1876 Struck Oil was played for 100 nights at the Adelphi theatre, London. Maggie Moore was one of the best loved actresses to have appeared in Australia.

					<center>THEATRES AND ENTERTAINMENT</center></a>
				<BR>
				The current season at the Princess's Theatre will terminate this week, and that at the Bijou Theatre next week, and after that there will be no theatre open in Melbourne until the Christmas holidays. This will be a position of affairs almost unprecedented in the history of the stage in Melbourne, certainly for a great many years past. It is easy to recall to memory instances in which there have at this time of the year been five theatres open, together with two or three music halls, a concert company at the Town-hall, fireworks displays, a circus, as well as numerous and diverse minor entertainments. Just at present New Zealand appears to be the favourite field for dramatic, musical, and 'variety' companies, there being no fewer than a dozen organisations 'on tour' in that colony, including Mr. J. C. Williamson's strong Comic Opera Company, Mr. Walter Bentley with a dramatic company, Mr. Alfred Dampier, the Montague-Turner Opera Company, Mr. G.H. Snazelle, Mr. Grattan Riggs, the Jubilee Singers and sundry minor combinations formed for public entertainment.</em></em>
