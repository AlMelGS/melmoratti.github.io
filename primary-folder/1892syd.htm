Not the least interesting event in connection with the celebration of the Christmas festivities is the appearance of the streets on Christmas Eve and when, as was the case this year, the 24th of December falls on a Saturday, a walk through the city affords no little pleasure. On Saturday night there was an enormous crowd of people abroad, and although to many the year rapidly closing has been one of great hardship, it is characteristic of the Australian that he allows no gloomy reflections to mar his thorough enjoyment of the season of peace and goodwill. The external decorations of the business premises are less profuse this year than they have been in times past, but in the principal business streets many of the shopkeepers had gone to considerable trouble in making as attractive a display as possible, and it must be admitted that the result was creditable and interesting. From an early hour the streets were crowded with pedestrians, and although there was some little crushing in the arcades and other popular resorts, and locomotion was at times difficult, the people on the whole were good-humoured, and pleasant greetings were much more frequent than menacing remarks and grumbling ejaculations.</p>

<center> <b>CRITERION THEATRE</b></center><br>

		<p class="bodyText10">

Since the Brough-Boucicault Comedy Company vacated the Criterion Theatre last June, the landlord (Mr. George Hill) has spent more than &pound;8000 upon the property, of which the decorations alone represent no less a sum than &pound;1500. The only external alteration consists in the addition of porticoes to the stalls and dress-circle entrances, and of a not very noticeable extension of the facade, by which the depth of the stage has been increased. The interior has, however, been much beautified and improved, and although the structure of the pretty little playhouse is not much changed, yet the alterations affecting the comfort of the audience are radical and sweeping. Entering the stalls by the dress-circle entrance, the spectator will note that much has been done by the architects, Messrs. Backhouse and Lindley, to give greater space and airiness to the interior. A little room at the back of the stalls has been abolished, and two alcoves with ventilators above have been added, whilst the space between the top of the swing doors and the ceiling enables the fresh air from the street to circulate above the heads of stallites, these said stallites will sit on seats richly upholstered in velvet plush by Messrs. Beard, Watson, and Co., and, as the obstructive beam beneath the dress-circle front has been removed, their lot should be an enviable one. From the centre of the stalls and from the stage the new architectural feature of the theatre, the dome, becomes visible - visitors to the dress-circle will of course be unable to view this notable improvement. The changes in their quarter of the house consist in a better arrangement of the "platform" of seats, and the creation of innumerable ventilators and exhaust shafts, in the provision of three alcoves daintily decorated in the Moorish style, in the lowering of the awkward barrier which backed the seats, and in the reconstruction of the boxes on either side. Apart from the elegance of the architectural effect the dome may be said to be devoted to the comfort of the family circle and gallery. It rises exactly over the family circle to a considerable height above the new roof, which is itself 12ft, higher than the old ceiling. As the house has been decorated throughout with great taste by Mr S W. Bradbury, the delicate tints of pale blue, duck-egg, fawn, cream, and old gold, give the auditorium the effect of lightness and grace which it formerly lacked. Mr. Robert Brough, whilst describing the various changes to our representative yesterday, dwelt with pardonable pride upon the comfort scoured for occupants of the family circle. In past years these seats were unpopular, as the "sunlight" hung too low, and the low ceiling helped to draw off the fumes into the house instead of out of it. The new sunlight, hanging high above, is of wrought iron, made by Messrs. Cassell and Co., of Newtown, the design showing lilies, waratahs, and tulips, in soft tints of white and pink, pale green and gold. Both electric light and gas are available here as elsewhere. Above the dome is the sliding roof, 8ft across, with great louvres for use in rainy weather. All round the base of the dome and ceiling are Boyle's patent ventilators. "Having suffered in silence so long," remarked Mr. Brough in this connection, "we 'let ourselves go' when we had the chance, so that ventilation is now the strong point of our cosy playhouse", Above the proscenium is a series of pictures by Mr. G. Walsh (of Bradbury and Co.), representing the Seven Ages of Man, whilst the proscenium frame is of terra cotta, crimson and gold. The opening is 2ft. wider than it was and 3ft. lower, and will thus form a well proportioned frame for the tableaux, of which some of especial beauty, from the brush of Mr. W. B Spong, will be shown in "Much Ado about Nothing". The stage itself is 10ft. deeper than it was, the exact size being 36ft. deep by 58ft. wide. The electric light has been installed throughout, but the additional rooms at the back will not be completed until the Pitt-street facade has been extended over the site formerly occupied by the New Zealand Hotel.</p>

		<p class="bodyText1">
Although theatres in Sydney flourished at the beginning of 1892 by the middle of the year many began to shut. At one stage there was only one large theatre in operation. Because of hardship audiences began to frequent the Music Hall. Here entrepreneur Henry Rickards made a killing with a variety programme that changed regularly and kept audiences continually amused. Visiting circus's were also popular. At one stage there were two, Wirth Brothers and Fillis's Circus, competing for patrons.

<p class="review"><span class="characterStyle3">

"<em>Mr Jewett makes a lusty Faust in his condition of recrudescence - wanting in fineness of touch, perhaps, but full of manliness and verve. He plays with much dash, and sustains his part with a considerable share of success. Miss Kate Bishop is well suited as Marguerite. She imparts to her rendering of the character a graceful touch, of girlish sentiment and freshness of manner, with a pleasing suggestion of that romanticism which we are accustomed to associate with the Marguerite of the story.</em>" </span></p>

<p class="bodyText1"> The last performance was on January 8th. On Saturday the 9th 'The Mikado' was mounted. This featured two Sydney lads. Master Robert Clough played Nanki-Poo and Master Harry Leader played Booh-Bah. On Monday the 18th 'The Pirates' returned for a couple of performances.

				<span class="boldletter">O</span>n Saturday 23rd the Brough-Boucicault Company returned with the first production in Australia of the farcical comedy by William Lestocq and Walter Everard entitled 'Uncles and Aunts'. This featured Tom Cannam and Charles Fabert from the Comedy Theatre, London, making their first appearance in Australia. </p>
<p class="review"><span class="characterStyle3">Of Mr. Cannam the reviewers said that &quot;<i>from the moment that he stepped upon the stage he became thoroughly at home with the audience</i>&quot;<br> Of Mr. Fabert the same reviewer said &quot;<i>he only appears in the last act and under the circumstances it is only fair to reserve a notice of his performance until he is able to do more justice to himself and the part entrusted to him.</i>&quot;</span></p>
<p class="bodyText1"> [Editor's note: Tom Cannam continued his Australian stage career well into the 20th century later appearing with the J.C. Williamson company and in a couple of movies from the silent era]<br>
 'Uncles and Aunts' played until February 12th. On February 13th there was the first performance in Australia of 'The Solisiter' by J.H. Darnley. Robert Brough was in the title role. </p>
<p class="review"><span class="characterStyle3">

"<em>The central figure in the piece is, of course, the Solicitor, Gilbert Brandon, whose unfortunate happenings form the central idea of the plot. It is a part exactly suited to Mr Brough, whose peculiar knack of depicting semi-pathetic, semi-humorous misery enables him to keep the audience in roars of laughter at his troubles. The solicitor's wife, Mrs Brandon, was treated in a delicate and finished style by Miss Emma Bronton, who, both by her dress and make-up, gave a sympathetic picture of a beautiful woman in distress.</em>"

On the 16th there was advertised a variety programme featuring Edith Lynne from London and '<i>20 eminent star artists secured by the management at considerable trouble and expense</i>'.

<p class="review"><span class="characterStyle3">&quot;<i>Signor Melossi made a great hit here in the baritone part as King Carlo, the other principals joined in the intensely dramatic music of the well-contrived situation, and Signor Maffezzoli brought up both chorus and orchestra to the expected musical climax with great judgement.</i>&quot;</span></p>

"<em>The acting all round was fully up to the standard required by the drama.

On Saturday March 26th the George Sims drama 'Life's Rough Road' was staged for the first time in Australia.
 </p>
<p class="review"><span class="characterStyle3">
"<em>As in the case of many melodramas of similar character, the scenery forms an important feature in the representation, and to the frequent changes which please the eye is probably due the lack of strong continuity in the plot.  Mr George Rignold was at his best in the dock scene, where  the agony of the cry, "Give mo work, sir, give me work," was a touching piece of emotional acting and the speeches in the garret had the true ring about them</em>."

 </p>
<p class="review"><span class="characterStyle3">
"<em>Sigiiorinu Guidotti, the new Margherita, was very well received by the house. However, since discrimination is necessary, it may be said at once that the soprano was at her best in the last two acts of the opera, the quality of the voice was always liquid and beautiful, but in the "Jewel Song" and elsewhere the artist was too obviously saving her voice and this too conscious care robbed the impersonation of the lightness and spontaneity which should characterise it in the earlier scenes.</em>"</span></p>
<p class="bodyText1">

 The opera was repeated again the following Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. 

On the Thursday and Friday there were performances of 'Un Ballo in Maschera'.
 </p>
<p class="review"><span class="characterStyle3">
"<em>Guiseppe Vilalta is to bo congratulated upon his Riccardo. The tenor still makes his points with the gallery by a forcing of the voice which every cultivated ear must disapprove but when this has been said, due weight must be given both to the aplomb with which the artist acted the part, and to the brilliancy and readiness with which he sang it.</em>"
</span></p>
<p class="bodyText1">

	The final week of the Italian Opera Company season at the <strong>Theatre Royal</strong> commenced on Saturday 5th with the popular 'Lucia di Lammermoor' staged once again.
 </p>
<p class="review"><span class="characterStyle3">
"<em>As a whole, we are inclined to think this the best-performed opera of the present season, and probably no one will dispute that Lucia is Signoru Cuttica's best part. The music suits the quality of the voice, and the rendering is in every department, vocally and histrionically, of the most delicately artistic character. Thus again on Saturday the prima donna carried off the honours of the evening.</em>"
</span></p>
<p class="bodyText1">
This was followed on the Monday by 'Faust', then 'Un Ballo in Maschera', 'The Barber of Seville' (on Wednesday and Friday) and 'Il Trovatore'. On Saturday the 12th the company moved to the <strong>Garrick Theatre</strong> for, what was to be, one final week.</p>

 </p>
<p class="review"><span class="characterStyle3">
"<em>Mr Glenney soon won the favour of the house, and the manly conduct of his hero, as well as the spirited way in which he delivered the little speeches the dramatist has put into the part secured frequent and cordial applause.</em>"
(Sydney Morning Herald)<br>
"<em>The whole performance seemed to afford great enjoyment to the large audience that witnessed it. The 'comic relief' was thrown in with complete success by Mr. Bland Holt as the jolly young waterman of the period, attired in the appropriate costume, coat and badge, etc.</em>" (Evening News)

 </p>
<p class="review"><span class="characterStyle3">
"Miss Ida Liston, the new soubrette actress, made a decidedly favourable impression as Rosa Colombier, a part she acted with a great deal of spirit.  The new-comer, who has a graceful stage presence, was prettily dressed in buttercup silk, with a corset-shaped bodice of russet velvet; and in the second act sang Mr. G. L.

"Mr Anson had a tremendous reception, and the applause lasted so long that the  actor had every excuse for feeling embarassed - though wo suspect that Mr Anson is case-hardened in this respect, aand past "flattery to tears" by the golden tongue, which is the actor's sweetest music."

 On Tuesday and Thursday another first by the current company. This was 'Lucrezia Borgia'. 
  </p>
<p class="review"><span class="characterStyle3">
 "Signorina Guidotti, the new "Lucrezin Borgia," has so fine a stage presence, that with but little effort she gave dignity and distinction to the role.

"Mr. G. S. Titheradge, who had an immense reception upon his re-appearance, gives a thoroughly clever and harmonious rendering of the part of Wilding, alias Captain Swift. Miss Seymour's re-appearance on the stage aftter a long absence proved a decided element of strength in the representation. Richly dressed, with an elegant figure and an aristocratic face, Miss Seymour filled the part of Lady Staunton to perfection, giving it weight and interest by the repose of her manner and the charm of a pleasant voice."

"<em>Mr. Bland Holts revival of "Master and Man" at the Theatre Royal on Saturday was received with the most demonstrative enthusiasm. Seldom has an audience been more evidently in holiday mood, and the comic repartees of Tom Honeywood were welcomed with shouts of laughter. Stalls and gallery were unusually crowded, and though the piece went well throughout, the audience more readily recognised the fun of the fable than its pathos.</em>"</span></p>

"Mr. Cecil Ward, has done nothing so good as his Tom Jones. Last night he again delighted the audience. He quite looks the "pretty fellow" described by Honor as having "a hand for his friends, a kiss for a pretty girl, and a smile for all the world"; and running through all the boisterous high-spirits of the part the actor adroitly shows a certain pathos and earnestness of purpose which is continually peeping out."

"<em>"Little Jack Sheppard" is a first rate burlesque, and it is so chiefly because it is strong in its music, an all-important department to which Florian Pascal, Meyer Lutz, Michael Watson, Corney Grain, Alfred Cellier, and many other composers have contributed sparkling and vivacious melodies. Mr John Brauton has painted some beautiful scenery for the new production. There is the pretty landscape and woodland view, with the mill and the foaming river in the distance, which forms the subject of the first act at "Doll's Hill Farm", and again the change from the cells to the outside of the prison, with the bird's-eye view of smoky London as seen from the leads, furnishes further illustration of the " burlesque-operatic-melodrama" - to quote its original (very original!) description.</em>"

On Saturday the 6th the ever popular 'Dorothy' returned.
</p>
<p class="review"><span class="characterStyle3">
"<em>Just at tbe last moment an unexpected alteration in the cast was made by which Misa Clara Merivale appeared as Dorothy. Miss Merivale played Dorothy two years ago in Melbourne, and being telegraphed for on Friday only arrived in time for one hurried rehearsal on the afternoon of Saturday's production. There were thus occasional hesitancies at night, but the impersonation gives promise of being one of the attractions of the new cast. Miss Merivale acts throughout with vivacity, and her vocal style is particularly refined.</em>" 
</span></p>
<p class="bodyText1">
'Dorothy' continued until Tuesday 16th. There was a performance of 'The Mikado' on Wednesday 17th with a special matinee performance on the 18th. 
</p>
<p class="review"><span class="characterStyle3">
"<em>Miss Clara Merivale is seen at her best as Yum Yum,which she plays with ludicrous little giggles and ogling glances which are quite in character. Her gestures are graceful, and she plays quietly, and without that over-emphasis and restless desire to bo perpetually in evidence, which is the failing of more than one clever little Australian actress in this company. Her singing of "The Sun Whose Rays" was especially sweet and refined.</em>"

The evening performances of the 18th and 19th were devoted to a revival of 'The Yeomen of the Guard' with George Lauri appearing for the first time as Jack Point.

'The Old Guard' by Planquette played on Saturday the 20th.
</p>
<p class="review"><span class="characterStyle3">
	"<em>Mr Lauri as the lively Major of Vaudrez-les-Vignes has added another to his list of successes. Throughout the opera, the exquisite fooling with which teh character is so largely invested, was immensely relished by the audience.</em>"

After a week 'The Old Guard' was replaced by 'Pepita', by Charles Lecocq, on Saturday the 27th. Flora Graupear played the title role.

"<em>Miss Graupner, who, as a rule is a most even and consistent singer, happened to be tired and out of voice on Saturday. Miss Violet Varley appeared to advantage as Inez and made good use of the opportunity afforded by the composer in "Do not, my own, be prying".</em>"

"<em>Everything in the performance seemed to delight the audience, and sentimental ballads rendered in the vocal style characteristic of the music-hall were encored with an evident determination to be pleased, which is not  always noticeable in the concert-room, even when singers of the highest reputation are upon the platform. Thus the stamp of popular approval has been set unmistakably both upon the  Gaiety Company and upon the first or the three new burlesques they bring with them from London. Miss Marion Hood is the handsome Marguerite of the burlesque but no longer sings with the refinement of her earlier days. The constant drawling of the voice and the forcing of the lower notes is, of course, intentionally done, for Miss Hood is an artist who thoroughly understands the line of business to which she has devoted herself since she forsook the higher walks of comic opera.</em>"

He was a Doctor of Music and an MA graduate and became the composer for several of the earliest Victorian musical comedies.

He had a moderate success with 'His Excellency', a comic opera with a libretto by W. S. Gilbert. He retired in 1916 and almost immediately died of a heart attack aged 58.

Lillie Napier is of imposing stature, and in well-contrasted colours of grey and scarlet with a yellow fur worn coquettishly upon the head, doubtless looked her best. Her opening "Jodel" song showed the range of a very powerful mezzo-soprano voice, into which, however, the singer needs to throw more sympathy can eau co-exist with an almost constant fortissimo.

It might be an idea to give you an idea of what a typical evening at the theatre with the Rickards Company might consist of. The evening would start with an Overture. This would be followed by a couple of songs by various members of the company. There would be a comic monologue or song followed by something serious. On the Christmas programme Blanche Montague sang "Love's Golden Dream". This was followed by various songs both comic and the more serious from the likes of Fred Dark, John Lindsay, Johnny Gilmore, Kate Richards and others. The comic number "Yodeliety" ended the first half of the programme. A serious ballad opened the second half to be followed by the lady contortionist, Pearl Akarman. This was followed by a couple of ballads and a selection on the violin by Katherine Vinceni. Harry Rickards appeared in several original character impersonations. This was followed by an Irish ballad and the whole performance concluded with the extravaganza "Gay Paris". The minstrel part of the whole evening would consist of songs, ballads, jokes and witticisms interspersed with the artists and items mentioned above.
