<p class="bodyText6"><span class="boldletter">D</span>uring the 1950s there were several new productions but the most important was that of <i><a href="ida.htm">Princess Ida,</a></i> in 1954. Costumes and stage sets were designed by James Wade giving the Opera a dream-like quality.
</p>
	<p class="bodyText6"><span class="boldletter">T</span>he Winter season of 1958-59  was a memorable one. Thomas Round had rejoined the Company and Kenneth Sandford, Jeffrey Skitch and Jennifer Toye were recent arrivals. The last night of that season was the last appearance of both Ann Drummond-Grant and Peter Pratt. Ann became seriously ill and died in September of that year. Peter decided he wanted a change and left the company after playing the comic roles for eight years.</p>

<p class="bodyText6"><span class="boldletter">J</span>ohn Reed joined the Company in 1951 as a member of the chorus and understudy to Peter Pratt. He took over the principal roles in 1959. During the following 20 years he witnessed many changes in the company.</p>
<p class="bodyText6"><span class="boldletter">A</span>t the end of 1961 the Company's monopoly on the operas disappeared with the expiry of the copyright. Some feared that this might harm the company but this proved not to be the case. It was around this time that Bridget D'Oyly Carte formed the D'Oyly Carte Opera Trust, Ltd.</p>
<p class="bodyText6">
<span class="boldletter">T</span>he Company continued to issue recordings. All the operas were re-recorded with John Reed in the principal roles. <i><a href="utopia.htm">Utopia Ltd</a></i> and <i><a href="grand.htm">The Grand Duke</a></i> were issued for the first time. Guest artists included Owen Brannigan and Elizabeth Harwood, and Sir Malcolm Sargent was guest conductor for <i><a href="yeomen.htm">The Yeomen of the Guard</a></i> and <i><a href="ida.htm">Princess Ida</a></i>.</p>
<p class="bodyText6"><span class="boldletter">T</span>he Company was also increasingly involved with film and television. A new film of <i><a href="mikado.htm">The Mikado</a></i> was made in 1967 and there were television broadcasts of <i><a href="patience.htm">Patience</a></i> and <i><a href="pinafore.htm">H.M.S. Pinafore</a></i>. <br>
<p class="bodyText6"><span class="boldletter">T</span>he highlight of the John Reed years was the Centenary Season of 1975 where each of the operas were presented in sequence, ending with a new production of <i><a href="utopia.htm">Utopia Ltd</a></i> and a concert performance of <i><a href="grand.htm">The Grand Duke</a></i>.</p>
<p class="bodyText6"><span class="boldletter">B</span>ridget D'Oyly Carte was created a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire and an O.B.E. was awarded to John Reed.<br>

<p class="bodyText6"><span class="boldletter">T</span>he Company continued to tour both nationally and internationally. In 1979 the Company made a highly successful 17-week tour of Australia and New Zealand. This was the first time the Company had ventured to Australasia although many former members had performed there over the years.</p>
<p class="bodyText6"><span class="boldletter">J</span>ohn Reed retired in 1979 after 28 years with the Company.</p>
<p class="bodyText6"><span class="boldletter">J</span>ohn Conroy-Ward, who had joined the Company in 1973, took over the comedy roles. Others singers still on the stage included Kenneth Sandford, John Ayldon and Meston Reid. Fraser Goulding became the conductor.</p>
<p class="bodyText6"><span class="boldletter">C</span>osts of touring and productions rose and the Company started to struggle financially. Arts Council funded dropped and a 'Save the D'Oyly Carte' appeal started, but it failed to raise sufficient money in time.</p>
<p class="bodyText6"><span class="boldletter">T</span>he farewell season took place at the Adelphi Theatre, London, from November 1981 to February 1982., with John Reed and Valerie Masterson as guest artists and Sir Charles MacKerras and Alexander Faris as guest conductors.</p>
<p class="bodyText6">
<span class="boldletter">T</span>hree years later Dame Bridget died leaving a legacy of &pound;1 million. Richard Condon was engaged as General Manager and secured generous continuing sponsorship from Sir Michael Bishop and British Midland Airways. </p>
<p class="bodyText6">
<span class="boldletter">I</span>n 1988 the company reformed and new productions of <i><a href="iolanthe.htm">Iolanthe</a></i> and <i><a href="yeomen.htm">The Yeomen of the Guard</a></i> toured the nation. Annual seasons continued, and from 1993 the repertoire was extended to include non Gilbert and Sullivan works.</p>
<p class="bodyText6">
<span class="boldletter">I</span>n September of 1998 the company relocated back to London and is now resident in Kennington, South London. Touring agreements were formed and there have been successful seasons at the Royal Festival Hall and the Queen's Theatre on Shaftesbury Avenue.</p>
<p class="bodyText6">
<span class="boldletter">F</span>or over a hundred and thirty years the Company was a source of delight to millions of people. The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company will remain an important chapter in the history of the English Theatre.
