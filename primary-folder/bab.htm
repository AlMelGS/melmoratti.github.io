<p class="heading1" align="center"><b>The Modest Couple</b></p>
<p class="bodyText1">
<center>Written for <i>Fun</i>, 8th Aug. 1868<br></center></p>

<dl><dt><p class="bodyText1">

<dl><dt>When man and maiden meet, I like to see a drooping eye,<br> 
<dl><dt>I always droop my own--I am the shyest of the shy.<br> 
<dl><dt>I'm also fond of bashfulness, and sitting down on thorns,<br> 
<dl><dt>For modesty's a quality that womankind adorns.<br>
			</dl>
		</dl>
	</dl>
</dl><p>
<dl><dt>Whenever I am introduced to any pretty maid,<br> 
<dl><dt>My knees they knock together, just as if I were afraid; <br>
<dl><dt>I flutter, and I stammer, and I turn a pleasing red, <br>
<dl><dt>For to laugh, and flirt, and ogle I consider most ill-bred.<br>
			</dl>
		</dl>
	</dl>
</dl><p>
<dl><dt>But still in all these matters, as in other things below,<br>
<dl><dt>There is a proper medium, as I'm about to show.<br>
<dl><dt>I do not recommend a newly-married pair to try<br>
<dl><dt>To carry on as PETER carried on with SARAH BLIGH.<br>
			</dl>
		</dl>
	</dl>
</dl><p>
<dl><dt>Betrothed they were when very young--before they'd learnt to speak<br>
<dl><dt>(For SARAH was but six days old, and PETER was a week);<br>
<dl><dt>Though little more than babies at those early ages, yet<br>
<dl><dt>They bashfully would faint when they occasionally met.<br>
			</dl>
		</dl>
	</dl>
</dl><p>
<dl><dt>They blushed, and flushed, and fainted, till they reached the age of nine,<br>
<dl><dt>When PETER'S good papa (he was a Baron of the Rhine)<br>
<dl><dt>Determined to endeavour some sound argument to find<br>
<dl><dt>To bring these shy young people to a proper frame of mind.<br>
			</dl>
		</dl>
	</dl>
</dl><p>
<dl><dt>He told them that as SARAH was to be his PETER'S bride,<br>
<dl><dt>They might at least consent to sit at table side by side;<br>
<dl><dt>He begged that they would now and then shake hands, till he <dl><dt>was hoarse,<br>
Which SARAH thought indelicate, and PETER very coarse.<br>
			</dl>
		</dl>
	</dl>
</dl><p>
<dl><dt>And PETER in a tremble to the blushing maid would say,<br>
<dl><dt>&quot;You must excuse papa, MISS BLIGH,--it is his mountain way.&quot;<br>
<dl><dt>Says SARAH, &quot;His behaviour I'll endeavour to forget,<br>
<dl><dt>But your papa's the coarsest person that I ever met.&quot;<br>
			</dl>
		</dl>
	</dl>
</dl><p>
<dl><dt>&quot;He plighted us without our leave, when we were very young,<br>
<dl><dt>Before we had begun articulating with the tongue.<br>
<dl><dt>His underbred suggestions fill your SARAH with alarm;<br>
<dl><dt>Why, gracious me! he'll ask us next to walk out arm-in-arm!&quot;<br>
			</dl>
		</dl>
	</dl>
</dl><p>
<dl><dt>At length when SARAH reached the legal age of twenty-one,<br>
<dl><dt>The Baron he determined to unite her to his son;<br>
<dl><dt>And SARAH in a fainting-fit for weeks unconscious lay,<br>
<dl><dt>And PETER blushed so hard you might have heard him miles away.<br>
			</dl>
		</dl>
	</dl>
</dl><p>
<dl><dt>And when the time arrived for taking SARAH to his heart,<br> 
<dl><dt>They were married in two churches half-a-dozen miles apart <br>
<dl><dt>(Intending to escape all public ridicule and chaff),<br>
<dl><dt>And the service was conducted by electric telegraph.<br>
			</dl>
		</dl>
	</dl>
</dl><p>
<dl><dt>And when it was concluded, and the priest had said his say,<br>
<dl><dt>Until the time arrived when they were both to drive away,<br>
<dl><dt>They never spoke or offered for to fondle or to fawn,<br>
<dl><dt>For he waited in the attic, and she waited on the lawn.<br>
			</dl>
		</dl>
	</dl>
</dl><p>
<dl><dt>At length, when four o'clock arrived, and it was time to go,<br> <dl><dt>The carriage was announced, but decent SARAH answered &quot;No!<br>

<dl><dt>Upon my word, I'd rather sleep my everlasting nap,<br>
<dl><dt>Than go and ride alone with MR. PETER in a trap.&quot;<br>
			</dl>
		</dl>
	</dl>
</dl><p>
<dl><dt>And PETER'S over-sensitive and highly-polished mind<br>
<dl><dt>Wouldn't suffer him to sanction a proceeding of the kind; <br>
<dl><dt>And further, he declared he suffered overwhelming shocks <br>
<dl><dt>At the bare idea of having any coachman on the box.<br>
			</dl>
		</dl>
	</dl>
</dl><p>
<dl><dt>So PETER into one turn-out incontinently rushed,<br>
<dl><dt>While SARAH in a second trap sat modestly and blushed;<br>
<dl><dt>And MR. NEWMAN'S coachman, on authority I've heard,<br>
<dl><dt>Drove away in gallant style upon the coach-box of a third.<br>
			</dl>
		</dl>
	</dl>
</dl><p>
<dl><dt>Now, though this modest couple in the matter of the car<br>
<dl><dt>Were very likely carrying a principle too far,<br>
<dl><dt>I hold their shy behaviour was more laudable in them<br>
<dl><dt>I hall that of PETER'S brother with MISS SARAH'S sister EM.<br>
			</dl>
		</dl>
	</dl>
</dl><p>
<dl><dt>ALPHONSO, who in cool assurance all creation licks,<br>
<dl><dt>He up and said to EMMIE (who had impudence for six),<br>
<dl><dt>&quot;MISS EMILY, I love you--will you marry? Say the word!&quot;<br>
<dl><dt>And EMILY said, &quot;Certainly, ALPHONSO, like a bird!&quot;<br>
			</dl>
		</dl>
	</dl>
</dl><p>
<dl><dt>I do not recommend a newly-married pair to try<br>
<dl><dt>To carry on as PETER carried on with SARAH BLIGH<br>
<dl><dt>But still their shy behaviour was more laudab]e in them<br>
<dl><dt>Than that of PETER'S brother with MISS SARAH'S sister EM.<br>
