<img src="../pics/pixel.gif" width=15 height=1 alt="" border="0">The Early History of the Australian Theatre: <br>
Regular professional theatre began in Sydney in the early 1830s with the opening of the Theatre Royal, with a capacity of over 1,000. Unfortunately the Royal burned down in 1840 and a new theatre, the Royal Victoria, seating 2,000, was built in Pitt Street.
<br><br>
In 1842 a rickety wooden pavilion known as the Theatre Royal was host to Melbourne playgoers. It was later renamed the Victoria but by 1845 it had closed. At this time another theatre, the Queen's Theatre Royal, was opened in Queen St. Francis Nesbitt lead the first resident company there. The towns first pantomime, <i>The Goblin of the Gold Coast</i>, was performed there in May 1850.<br><br>
Although there were ballet programmes as early as 1835, the first major romantic ballet produced in Australia was the two-act <i>La Sylphide</i>. This opened at the Queen's Theatre Royal in Melbourne on September 25th 1845. Excerpts from the classic <i>Giselle</i> were given at the Royal Victoria in Sydney in 1855 by Aur&eacute;lia Dimier who was in the original Paris production of 1841.<br>

		<p class="bodyText1"> <span class="boldletter">W</span>illiam Saurin Lyster (1827-1880)
was a colourful American impresario who, concerned about the possible looming American Civil War,
set sail for Australia. Gold had recently been discovered in Victoria which made Melbourne the
largest and most prosperous of all Colonial cities. Lyster arrived in Melbourne in March 1861 and
set up his own opera company. This was one of the very first chances that Antipodean audiences
could taste full scale productions of European Opera. For the next two decades Lyster was to reign
supreme. The Royal Italian and English Opera Company extended its activities to other Victorian
towns and then toured up to Sydney. In 1864 the Company steamed over the Tasman and toured the
whole of New Zealand.

Australasia. George Benjamin Allen (1822-1897) was responsible for introducing Op&eacute;ra bouffe

operettas performed consisted of various English and French works of the day. The favourite was the
popular <I>Genevi&egrave;ve de Brabant</I> by the French master, Jacques Offenbach. This featured

Company was actor-singer Howard Vernon who would later become Australasia's leading exponent of
Gilbert and Sullivan. This Company first introduced Sullivan's <I>Cox and Box</I> to Australia and
New Zealand. This was premiered in Sydney's Masonic Hall on December 26th, 1872. In the same evenings entertainment were Offenbach's <i>The Rose of Auvergne</i> and Allen's own work <i>The Belle of Wooloomooloo</i>. Howard Vernon took the role of Box.<br>
The New Zealand premiere of <i>Cox and Box</i> with the Alice May Company took place in Wellington on June 20th, 1874, with Howard Vernon still in the cast.

June 7th, 1879. Horace Lingard's company played at the Academy of Music and Richard Stewart and his
family opened a production at St George's Hall. The reviewer in the Melbourne Age said of the work:
&quot;<I>The piece taken as a whole may be regarded as occupying a secondary place to Offenbach's
opera bouffes. It certainly is not equal, either as a comic or musical work, to any of the best
productions of the vivacious French composer.</I>&quot;</p>
<p class="bodyText1"><span class="boldletter">T</span>he Richard Stewart production featured an up and coming actress, Nellie Stewart. What was unique about this production was that Nellie Stewart played Ralph! The critic for the Melbourne Age
on June 10th said: &quot;<I>Miss Nellie Stewart represented Ralph, and acted as well as sang the
music incidental to the part in a most satisfactory manner.</I>&quot;</p>
<p class="bodyText1">
<span class="boldletter">I</span>n New Zealand there were several productions of &quot;Pinafore&quot; being performed in various centers throughout the later part of 1879.
In June of that year three different productions opened within days of each other. On the 16th the H Towles Amateurs opened in Christchurch (Surprisingly this was incorrectly advertised as the very first production in Australasia.)
