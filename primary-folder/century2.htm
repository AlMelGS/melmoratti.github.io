The company was the first to introduce 'Cox and Box' to Australia in 1872. Vernon played Box. With the Alice May Opera Company he toured New Zealand and India. In 1874 Howard scored his first major success as a tenor with the Lyster Opera Company in a production of <i>Lily of Killarney</i>. Wellington's Evening Post said "<em>Mr Vernon's performance as Myles would suffice to stamp him as an actor of the first order and a very excellent tenor singer.</em>"  Howard was to spend 30 years performing G &amp; S in Australasia, becoming the leading &quot;patter&quot; singer in this part of the world.

Nothing unusual about this, as she was extremely popular with New Zealand audiences, except that the benefit was performed on board a real ship (the St. Leonards) anchored in the Wellington harbour. When Sir Joseph's barge approached (rowed by half a dozen men from the Naval Brigade) real cannons and rifles were actually fired. When the First Lord actually did manage to arrive on board it was difficult for the audience not to join in a round of cheers.

This production had a distinct pantomime feel with the casting of male performer Cecil Riverton as Ruth. The reviewer in the Evening Post said at the time &quot;<i>Mr. Riverton's Ruth was excessively comic, dramatically, but musically would have improved by some of the phrases being taken an octave higher, as the part was really written for a contralto</i>.&quot;</p>

Annie Leaf played Ruth in most performances. There was such a demand for the piano score that it out sold the revised edition of the New Testament. The result was that some Christians voiced a grievance over whether New Zealand was a Christian country! On a bit of a sad note, Cary lost around &pound;800 on the whole venture and filed for bankruptcy in June 1882.

<i>The Wreck of the Pinafore!</i> is a continuation of the G &amp; S original. The characters from the earlier work, before they enter the bonds of wedlock, embark on a cruise. A hurricane sets in and they get wrecked. Ralph Rackstraw, instead of proving himself 'the foremost man' on the ship neglects Josephine and looks after only himself. Sir Joseph shows himself to be a thoroughly brave fellow and quickly intergrates himself into Josephine's good books. The Captain likewise discovers that Buttercup is an ill-bred woman and beneath his station, and so marries Hebe. Buttercup when taxed, admits that her story about mixing the babies was untrue, and the absurdity of it is shown by the fact that the Captain is so much Ralph's senior in years. The Opera closes with the shipwrecked people being rescued.<br>

The Times reviewer on May 29th, 1882, said &quot;<i>The music, though for the most part a meaningless jingle, did in one or two songs and choruses rise above the level of the libretto and so afforded an opportunity to a friendly section of the audience to express their approval.</i>&quot;

During the popularity of <i>Pinafore</i> &amp; <i>Pirates</i> it became fashionable to tour the country with a juvenile cast. This idea was first launched at the Op&eacute;ra Comique, London, in December, 1879. The <i>Children's Pinafore</i> roused the wrath of Lewis Carroll who was 'sad beyond words' when he heard the juvenile Captain use that 'big, big D---'. The author could not understand how Gilbert could have stooped to write 'such vile trash'.<br>
In Australia and New Zealand the tiny tot productions became so popular that often there were two different companies touring at the same time.</p><br>

&quot;A black cook takes the place of the sailor who dances the hornpipe, which is a commendable change. The young lad who takes the part dances capitally in the negro breakdown style.&quot;<br>

Of course, not all concerned were positive. This note in Wellington's Evening Post (May 9th, 1881):<br>

<img src="../pics/pixel.gif" width=15 height=1 alt="" border="0">
&quot;Can nothing be done to put a stop to the employment of children of tender years on the stage? The law is very strict in prescribing the  number of hours  adult women shall be employed in factories...However, there seems to be absolutely no protection for the poor little babes who are collected night after night before the garish footlights...Who does not remember the pathetic story of the poor little fellow at Sydney, whose unnatural exertions, night after night, in 'Pinafore', cost him his life, and who died singing, in his delirium, the 'Captain's Song'.&quot;<br>

   </p>
	<p class="bodyText1" align="left">
Tom Pollard was someone who was very important in the development of the Juvenile Opera Companies.</p>
<p class="bodyText1" align="left">
 Tom Pollard was Tasmanian by birth but spent much of his life in New Zealand. Tom was born on April 28th, 1857, as O'Sullivan. James Joseph Pollard ran a small company in Tasmania in which Tom played second fiddle. Because everyone else in the orchestra were Pollard brothers and sisters, Tom adopted the family name which he retained for the rest of his life.</p>
<p class="bodyText1" align="left">
 J.J. Pollard's company was a family business which started in Tasmania, then toured smaller Australian towns and finally moved over to New Zealand.</p>
<p class="bodyText1" align="left">
Tom initially took over as stage director and when J.J. Pollard died Tom carried on the Company. He married Emily Pollard, J.J.'s daughter.</p>
<p class="bodyText1" align="left">
Pollard's Liliputian Opera Company began its first New Zealand tour in 1881. On March 15th <i>H.M.S. Pinafore</i> opened at Sloan's Theatre, Invercargill.</p>
<p class="bodyText1" align="left">
During the period 1880-1886 the first Pollard Company performed  <i>Patience</i> (Auckland, March 1885) and <i>The Pirates of Penzance</i> (Dunedin, June 1885). Also in their repertoire were <i>Les Cloches de Corneville</i> (Panquette), <i>La Fille de Madame Angot</i> (Lecocq), <i>La Mascotte</i> (Audran) and Gilbert's play <i>Sweethearts</i>.</p>
<p class="bodyText1" align="left">
The unique thing about the Pollard Company was that it began with a group of boys and girls - from ages ten to thirteen - and that they kept together. As the children grew up the Company changed from being called the Liliputian Opera Company to the more adult Pollard's Opera Company. Mr and Mrs Pollard cared for all the children - they dressed and educated them. <p>

</p>
<p class="bodyText1" align="left">
For 22 years the Pollards entertained the country with 42 different productions among them several Gilbert and Sullivan works.</p>
<p class="bodyText1" align="left">
The last production of the Pollard's in New Zealand was the opera <i>Tapu</i>, written by New Zealand author, Arthur H. Adams, and composed by another New Zealander, Alfred Hill. The New Zealand Times wrote:<br> &quot;<i>Tapu</i> is full of melody. Mr Hill has displayed a wealth of resource in scoring picturesque, varied and spontaneous music, full of graceful and characteristic melody, and has at the same time proved his artistic judgement by avoiding the merely superficial.&quot;</p>
<p class="bodyText1" align="left">
The Pollard organisation finally disbanded while touring South Africa. Tom Pollard returned to New Zealand. He organised a new Juvenile Company. Its first play <i>Bluebell in Fairyland</i> was a runaway success. The first season in Christchurch repaid the production costs. It then toured the country returning for a second and a third season in Christchurch. </p>
<p class="bodyText1" align="left">
Pollard became involved in the movie business. During the Great War he acted as film-advisor to the Government.</p>
<p class="bodyText1" align="left">
He died in 1922.</p>
