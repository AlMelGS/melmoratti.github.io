marked the beginning of Williamson's long career as Australia's foremost theatrical manager. This
was the first of many theatres which would eventually become part of the organisation, J.C.
Williamson Theatres Ltd. Also known as &quot;The Firm&quot;.

with a quartet of American and English plays. It was while touring that Williamson decided to

the Tasman and show New Zealand what G &amp; S were all about.

especially to carry touring theatrical companies.

	<p class="bodyText1"><span class="boldletter">O</span>n May the 23rd <I>Patience</I> opened the newly completed Abbott's Opera House in Auckland. The Auckland Weekly News had this to say about the venue: <br>&quot;Abbott's new Opera House in Wellesley street was opened on Tuesday night for the first season by Mr. Williamson. The new theatre itself has been the source of considerable interest for some days previously, and was visited by a large number of the general public. Certainly nothing could be better arranged for comfort and convenience than the interior fittings.&quot;  Only seven months were occupied in building the theatre.</p>
	<p class="bodyText1">
	<span class="boldletter">W</span>illiamson's close attention to detail resulted in reviews which favourably compared his production with the original London one:<br> &quot;There are some passages of great musical beauty in this opera. Miss Alice Rees possesses one of the purest soprano voices we have heard. It is admirable in its display of modulation and definite tone. Mr. Howard Vernon as actor, and Miss Novarro as vocalist, produced the the most uncontrollable fun and laughter. There is a duet, which may be called the &quot;pooh-pooh&quot; duet, which they had to sing four times. The most rapid effects of rhyme and music are curiously woven with the extraordinary conceits of the librettist and the special powers of adaptation of the composer.&quot; (Auckland Weekly News)</p>
	<p class="bodyText1"> <span class="boldletter">T</span>he tour was a success both artistically and financially.
	</p>
	<p class="bodyText1"><span class="boldletter">T</span>wenty five years were to pass before Williamson himself would return to New Zealand. He had
	assembled a theatrical empire which knew no equal in this part of the world.
</p>
	<p class="bodyText1"><span class="boldletter">W</span>henever Williamson produced anything successfully in Australia it was usually brought across
	the Tasman. Even though New Zealanders did not see the man again for a quarter of a century they were
	never unaware of the Williamson name.
</p>
	<p class="bodyText1">
	<span class="boldletter">T</span>he success of J.C. Williamson can be best summed up by the Auckland Weekly News:<br> &quot;Mr. Williamson has earned a very high reputation for enterprise in this department of dramatic business. He is diligent to import the novelties of each season for introduction to colonial audiences. He aims at attainment of a result equal to that obtained in London.&quot;</p>
