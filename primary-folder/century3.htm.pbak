Moreover, seat prices steadily declined as the century progressed. Where, in 1864, Lyster charged 10s 6d for the best seats, the top price demanded by his successors of the 1880s was 6s. Places in the pit could be obtained for as little as a shilling. <BR> <FONT face="Century Schoolbook" size="1" color="black"> from &quot;<I>Opera's farthest frontier</I>&quot; by Adrienne Simpson <BR> </FONT> </TD></TR></TABLE><BR> In September, 1881, Williamson took over the lease of the Theatre Royal, Melbourne. This marked the beginning of Williamson's long career as Australia's foremost theatrical manager. This was the first of many theatres which would eventually become part of the organisation, J.C. Williamson Theatres Ltd. Also known as &quot;The Firm&quot;. <BR> <BR> In late 1881, leaving G &amp; S aside for the time being, the Williamsons toured New Zealand with a quartet of American and English plays. It was while touring that Williamson decided to arrange his 50-strong Royal Opera Company, still playing to full houses in Sydney, to come across the Tasman and show New Zealand what G &amp; S were all about. <BR> <BR> There was a problem however. To move 50 people 1,300 miles was neither easy nor cheap. The Union Steam Ship Company refused to allow a discount for bulk transport. Williamson was cunning and in the local newspapers notices appeared publicizing a new charter shipping line that was refitted especially to carry touring theatrical companies. <BR> <BR> The Gilbert like plot worked and the Union Company called Williamson with a revised schedule of fares. <BR> <BR> In the end it took two ships to bring all the performers, stage staff and scenery over from Sydney. <BR> <BR> <CENTER> <IMG src="../pics/pic257.jpg" width=288height=264 alt="Otago Daily Times Feb. 21st 1882" border="0"> </CENTER> <BR> <BR> The company opened its New Zealand season at the Princess Theatre, Dunedin, on 27th February 1882.</FONT> <BR> <BR> <TD valign="top"><CENTER> <IMG src="../pics/pic026.jpg" width=400 height=274 alt="The Princess Theatre, Dunedin 1876" border="0"> </CENTER> <BR> <CENTER> <FONT face="Century Schoolbook" size="2" color="black">The Princess Theatre, Dunedin 1876</FONT> </CENTER> <BR> </FONT> </FONT> <TABLE align="center" width="55%" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="2" border="5" bordercolor="Green"><TR><TD valign="top"><FONT face="Century Schoolbook" size="2" color="black"> <IMG src="../pics/pixel.gif" width=15 height=1 alt="" border="0">Historic Note: <BR>The Princess Theatre, Dunedin, was first opened on March 5th, 1862.

Miss Rees had been discovered by Williamson when he was casting <I>Patience</I> for Sydney. Here was a real gem. <BR> <BR> The four main centres were all visited by the comic opera company during its 15 weeks tour. New Zealand were singing the three Ps - <I>Pinafore</I>, <I>Pirates</I> and <I>Patience</I>. <BR> <BR> On May the 23rd <I>Patience</I> opened the newly completed Abbott's Opera House in Auckland. Williamson's close attention to detail resulted in reviews which favourably compared his production with the original London one. <BR> The tour was a success both artistically and financially. <BR> <BR> Twenty five years were to pass before Williamson himself would return to New Zealand. He had assembled a theatrical empire which knew no equal in this part of the world. <BR> <BR> Whenever Williamson produced anything successfully in Australia it was usually brought across the Tasman. Even though New Zealanders did not see the man again for quarter of a century they were never unaware of the Williamson name. <BR> <BR> </FONT> <TABLE align="center" width="55%" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="2" border="5" bordercolor="Green"><TR><TD valign="top"><FONT face="Century Schoolbook" size="2" color="black"> <IMG src="../pics/pixel.gif" width=15 height=1 alt="" border="0">Historic Note: <BR>New operas often appeared in Australasia with astonishing rapidity.

The grander operas frequently did not lag too far behind. Verdi's <I>Aida</I> was seen in both Australia and New Zealand within six years of its original production and the 1877 premieres of Wagner's <I>Lohengrin</I> on both sides of the Tasman pre-dated those in all American cities save New York. <BR></FONT> <FONT face="Century Schoolbook" size="1" color="black"> from &quot;<I>Opera's farthest frontier</I>&quot; by Adrienne Simpson <BR> </FONT> </TD></TR></TABLE><BR> <BR> <BR> <TABLE width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2"><TR><TD align="left"><A href="century3.htm" target="_top" name="century3top">Back to the top</A> </TD><TD align="center"><A href="century4.htm#1882" target="_self" name="century4top">Continue your Down Under Adventures</A> </TD><TD align="right"><A href="reviews.htm" target="_top" name="reviewstop">Go to reviews</A> </TD></TR></TABLE><BR> <BR> <CENTER> <IMG src="../pics/noteline.gif" width="95%" height=40 alt="spacer" border="0"> </CENTER> </FONT> </BODY></HTML>
