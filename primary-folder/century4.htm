			<BR>M. Grevy has been the first person to inaugurate the theatrical telephone in his household.</a> (The) apparatus communicating with the Opera, Theatre Francais, and the Opera Comique, has been set in a drawing-room, on the first floor, looking into the garden. The number of recipients is 12 - four for each theatre. The work has been executed by M. Ader, who has introduced great improvements into this marvellous instrument. Notwithstanding the distance of 3000 metres between the Elysee and the Theatre Francais, the voices of the actors arrive as clear and distinct as in the theatre itself.

			<BR><i>The Martyr of Antioch</i> received two performances in Sydney around Easter, 1882. The Sydney Morning Herald said "<em>The principals, with the chorus and orchestra, worked so well, that the audience, which quite crowded the theatre, applauded and seemed thoroughly to appreciate the work.</em>" The first Melbourne performance was on Saturday June 21st, 1884, at the Town Hall. Alice Rees, at short notice, sung the principal soprano music.

		<p class="bodyText12">The first New Zealand performance was in Auckland at the end of November, 1888. The Observer noted that "<em>words cannot express the sympathetic charm of the music, which is an excellent specimen of the merits of the composer in melody, spirit, orchestration, and power.</em>"

<span class="boldletter">I</span>n 1882 Williamson organized the first of several partnerships. With Arthur Garner, he joined his greatest Australian rival, George Musgrove (1854-1916). The trio took over the Princess and Theatre Royal in Melbourne and the Theatre Royals in Sydney and Adelaide. Thus they had an access to the main centres of theatrical interest.

The theatre reopened just seventeen hours later with new carpets, stained glass in the lobby, velvet curtains in the archways of the foyer and inside the auditorium their was a new sunken orchestral pit. The inaugural production  in the revamped theatre was the first Melbourne performance of  <i>Patience</i>. <em>"The music, the scenery, the dresses, all lend their share of attraction to this most diverting performance but no one who has not heard the humours of the verbal text can form any conception of how inspiriting and exhilarating the entertainment is"</em> (Argus)

<span class="boldletter">I</span>n 1881 D'Oyly Carte introduced the electric light to the Savoy Theatre, the first time that a theatre had been lit entirely by electricity. On September 2nd, 1882, the electric light was first used publicly in a theatre in Australia - the Prince of Wales in Melbourne. The production was Suppe's <i>Boccaccio</i> which ran for over sixty performances and became the first successful Viennese operetta in Australia.</p>

			<BR>There Is no underground drainage system. All the sewage is carried away in huge open gutters, which run all through the town, and are at their
worst and widest in the most central part, where all the principal shops
and business places are situated. These gutters are crossed by little
wooden bridges every fifty yards. When it rains, they rise to the
proportion of small torrents, and have on several occasions proved fatal
to drunken men. In one heavy storm, indeed, a sober strong man was
carried off his legs by the force of the stream, and ignominiously
drowned in a gutter. You may imagine how unpleasant these little rivers
are to carriage folk. In compensation they are as yet untroubled with
tramways, although another couple of years will probably see rails laid
all over the city.

<span class="boldletter">O</span>n Wednesday July 9th, 1884, 'Patience' received its first official performance in Brisbane. The cast included Nellie Stewart (Patience), Fanny Liddiard (Lady Jane), Howard Vernon (Bunthorne), Edwin Kelly (Grosvenor) and T. Grundy (Colonel Calverly). The Brisbane Courier said "<em>Every point of detail in mounting the pieces appears to be made a study; the scenery generally is excellent and the costumes are not only brilliant and costly but are perfectly correct. Mr. Howard Vernon as Bunthorne brought a very high reputation with him, and we cannot say more of his performnace last evening than to admit that it fully bore out the opinion we were led to form concerning him. Competent judges say that he is the best representative of the part who has ever appeared, and that his appreciation of the grotesque humour of it is better from an artistic point of view than that of the original performer</em>."
