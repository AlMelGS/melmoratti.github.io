Musical note: The first performance of Beethoven's Opera 'Fidelio' was at the Melbourne Town Hall on the Monday September 15th, 1884. This was a concert performance by the Melbourne Liedertafel with Fannie Simonsen as Marcellina, Armes Beaumont as Florestan, and Elise Wiedermann in the title role. The Argus said "<em>In Madame Elise Wiedermann we possess a 1yric artist of fine vocal powers, of great natural sensibility, and of such experience as enables her to give us in our own language a true reading of the most heroic and interesting woman character that the history of opera supplies to us.</em>"

<p class="bodyText1">
			<span class="boldletter">T</span>he Age had this to say: &quot;<em>The music bears in every part the distinct individuality of the 
			composer, although having no actual resemblance to his other operas. The concerted numbers are cleverly 
			constructed, and many of the melodies extremely pretty, while the orchestration shows an artistic hand 
			and poetic imagination.</em>&quot;</p>
<p class="bodyText1"><span class="boldletter">A</span> season in Sydney followed with 'Iolanthe' opening on August 1st. Albert Brennir played Strephon.

The company then headed to Brisbane where 'Iolanthe' opened on Tuesday September 1st, 1885. Robert Brough played the Lord Chancellor and Nellie Stewart played Phyllis. The description by the Brisbane Courier of the production will give readers an insight into an actual G &amp; S staging in Australia. "<em>The 'Arcadian Landscape' in the first act is an exceedingly pretty set, and the scenery is such as might be expected from the pencil of such an experienced scenic artist as George Gordon, but is somewhat marred by one or two slight defects. For instance, the beautifully painted trees - apparently elms - which recall an English landscape, are hardly set off by boughs of undeniable bluegum, with leaves shrivelling up in the heat and glare of the gas-lights, and the bridge which spans the gauze river is altogether too heavy and massive for the otherwise fairy aspect of the scene. Instead of spanning an Arcadian rivulet it seems more adapted for providing a permanent way over Cabbage Tree Creek, but this heavy structure we are given to understand is necessary to support the weight of the 'military band', who presently use it as a grand stand. The costumes, as a matter of course, are magnificent; the robes of the peers, who, by the way, are all bald-headed and carry their hankerchiefs inside their coronets, and the jewels of the fairies being especially conspicuous. The 'military band' that preceded the procession of peers on their entry, and who usually occupied the bridge at the back of the stage, manifested a great improvement last night, and though rather too loud at times added much to the effectiveness of the score. A very effective feature of the performance was the electric lights worn on the foreheads of the fairies in the last act, which, twinkling brightly as they moved about, aroused the enthusiasm of the audience, who in other respects, were rather apathetic.</em>"

		<i><span class="boldletter">T</span>he Mikado</i> had its Australasian premiere at Sydney's Theatre Royal on November

			Nellie Stewart and Alice Barnett were all in the cast. This production would run continuously 
			until Christmas, closing finally on December 24th.</p>
			<p class="bodyText1">
			<span class="boldletter">T</span>able Talk had this to say: <br><img src="../pics/pixel.gif" width=40 height=1 alt="" border="0">&quot;<em>Certainly 
			Mr. Gilbert has never written anything more sarcastically humourous and Sir Arthur Sullivan has never composed 
			music more enticingly 'catchy'. As for the dresses, stage appointments and scenery, they are simply 
			perfection to the remotest detail.</em>&quot;</p>
<p class="bodyText1">
			<span class="boldletter">T</span>here were also revivals of <i>Patience</i>, <em>H.M.S. Pinafore</em>, <em>Iolanthe</em> and <i>The Pirates of Penzance</i>. One cast change, in the former, saw 
			Alice Barnett recreate her original London role of Lady Jane. The Sydney Morning Herald complimented the artist. "<em><em>There were many little points given for the first time, and a thorough self-control, whioh in the most amusing scenes prevented tho slightest approach to vulgarity. The duet, "So go to him" was a notable instance of Miss Barrnett's power; while entering fully into tho spirit of the thing, singing the musio as it has never been sung here before, she yet kept a curb on Mr, Vernon and took away the coarseness which occasionally marred the rendering. The duet was twice encored.</em></em>"</p>
<p class="bodyText1">
			<span class="boldletter">W</span>hen <i>The Mikado</i> opened in Melbourne, on February 20th, 1886, the famous D'Oyly Carte conductor, Alfred Cellier, 
			took over the baton. However it was discovered that Frank Boyle, who was to play Nanki-Poo, was too indisposed to 
			appear. There was no adequate understudy ready. J.C. Williamson was frantic with anxiety. A near catastrophe was 
			averted when W.H. Harrison, the conductor, who that night had relinquished his position to Alfred Cellier, said 
			that he knew the part. He went on and saved the performance.</p>
<p class="bodyText1">
After seasons in the major cities the operettas would eventually make their way around the smaller settlements. At the first performance of 'The Mikado' in Ballarat, in December 1886, the newspaper critic was not the most positive. <em>"The weakest part of the opera are the melodies, which are somewhat disappointing, though there are one or two catching airs."</em>

<img src="../pics/pixel.gif" width=15 height=1 alt="" border="0">&quot;In entering into your journalistic arena with TABLE TALK, we are acting upon a well-founded belief that Colonial Society has attained such a definite stage of development, has become crystallised into such a concrete and enduring form, that it merits more systematic and comprehensive treatment than it hitherto received at the hands of journalists. The daily newspapers of Melbourne and their weekly offshoots have done much in that direction, but our effort will be to do incomparably more.&quot;<br>
Articles in the first issue included two columns devoted to Gilbert and Sullivan entitled &quot;Satirical Opera&quot; and an article on <i>Iolanthe</i> entitled &quot;Wards in Charncery&quot;.<br>
Table Talk continued for some 2723 issues. The final publication was on September 14th 1939. Of interest the last, but one, issue featured the Gilbert and Sullivan Society of Victoria's presentation of <i>Iolanthe</i> and the Martyn Green movie <i>The Mikado</i>.

The stars shone on the evening of December 18th, 1886, when the new Princess Theatre opened its doors for the first time.
