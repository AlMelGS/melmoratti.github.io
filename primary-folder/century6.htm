      added. The company played there for a week in late May. The Hawkes Bay Herald on May 24th said &quot;<em>The dressing and mounting of 'The Mikado' may be described as worthy of unqualified praise, not a single detail being neglected. The grouping was excellent throughout, presenting harmonious and synchronous pictures alone worth a visit to the theatre.</em>&quot; A few days 'Iolanthe' was reviewed. &quot;<em>The opera was splendidly staged, the costumes, scenery, and lighting arrangements being perfect. In connection with the scenery the palm must be given to the set for the first act, an Arcadian landscape, which was one of the most artistic examples of stage work ever seen in Napier.</em>&quot;  There were two performances of 'Patience' on the final day. One was a benefit for the widows and children of the sailors who perished aboard the Northumberland when it had sunk in  Napier harbour a couple of weeks previously.</p>

               During the the last part of 1887 and the early part of 1888
               Australia had the pleasure of hearing the loved Savoyard,
               Leonora Braham.<br>
               She made her first appearance in <i>Dorothy</i> in Melbourne in
               August, 1887. This was followed by appearances in <i>The Mikado</i> and <i>Iolanthe</i>. In December, suffering from ill health, she managed just a few performnces of <i>H.M.S. Pinafore</i>. She also appeared, as Mabel, in a revival of <i>The
               Pirates of Penzance</i>. Table Talk had
               this to say about her performance: &quot;<em>Miss Leonora Braham took the
               part of Mabel, and was happily in better voice than she has yet
               been during her sojourn here. Whatever the course the result was
               more than satisfactory, and at the close of her first scene the
               audience broke into a storm of pleased applause for they
               perceived her effort and were not slow to appreciate it.</em>&quot;<br>
               Leonora also appeared in three productions by the J.C.
               Williamson Company in Sydney in 1888. In February she performed
               in a revival of <i>Iolanthe</i>, in April she was in a revival
               of <i>HMS Pinafore</i> and took the title role in the first
               Sydney production of <i>Princess Ida</i>. She returned to
               England not long after.<br>

               The first performance of <i>The Golden Legend</i> in Australia
			   was on Tuesday the 26th of June, 1888, at the Town-Hall, Adelaide. There were 220 performers on stage and the conductor was Mr. C.J. Stevens.
<br> There was a performance in Melbourne on Saturday the 11th of August, 1888. The Melbourne Philharmonic Society was conducted by David Lee. The critic of the Argus said: &quot;<em>The
               experience of a first performance was delightful. The society
               and their conductor deserve high praise. The work has greatly
               enhanced the fame of the composer.</em>&quot;<br>
			   There were another two Melbourne performances on Thursday November 29th and December 6th. The critic this time said: &quot;<em>Taken as a whole, and excepting one or two minor errors, the performance was most creditable to all concerned.</em>&quot;<br>
The first Sydney performance was on Wednesday February 11th, 1891 with a second performance following on the Saturday.

               Fact:<br>
               With each revival of 'The Mikado' there always seemed to be a change in the casting of the title role. In February 1889 Arthur Rigby was the seventh representative since the first Australian production. The original John Forde was in 1889 working in theatrical mangement. The second, Denbeish Newton, was a commercial traveller in Queensland. The third, Alfred Brennir, was in poor health. Federici was dead. Edwin Kelly became a farmer, and, Harry Benham (who was in the 1888 revival) was still in Melbourne appearing in the current pantomime.

			   Ada Mary Gardner was only 17 years old when, using the stage name of Ida Osborne, she joined the chorus of J. C. Williamson's opera company in Melbourne in 1881. Starting in the chorus she was always ready to take on anybody's part and to fit herself into anybody's costume. She always seemed to pull through triumphantly and eventually held a good position with the company. During the run of <i>The Mikado</i> she understudied Yum-Yum. Whenever she found herself in that role
her part of Pitti-Sing was taken by Josephine Green.

<p class="bodyText1">
 <span class="boldletter">A</span> Sydney season followed at the Theatre Royal on June 2nd, 1891, with a
      slight change of cast. Sydney Deane played Luiz, Henry Bracy played Marco,
      Elsie Cameron played the Duchess and the first appearance of Violet
      Varley &quot;<i>whose singing as Tessa is of material assistance to the piece. She was deservedly encored for her charming rendering of 'When a merry maiden marries'.</i>&quot; (Sydney Morning Herald)  </p>
 	<p class="bodyText1">
 <span class="boldletter">V</span>iolet Varley had a short but successful career with "The Firm". She was
      originally a member of Pollard's Juveniles. While singing in <i>The Old
      Guard</i> her voice charmed Sarah Bernardt and earned her a bouquet. In
      the early part of her stage career she scored a big hit in <i>La
      Cigale</i> playing the prima-donna character in Sydney, Melbourne and
      elsewhere.  She died, suddenly, at the age of only twenty four.   </p>

 <span class="boldletter">R</span>evivals of the old favourites were always in the touring repertoire. Always the revival was compared to the original Australian production. &quot;<i>The present revival of Iolanthe is the best of this opera the Williamson and Garner Opera Company have ever given, and in some instances it equals the original production.</i>&quot; (Table Talk on a revival in Melbourne in January 1891)

               Historic Note:<br>
               As previously mentioned often several productions by the
               Williamson Companies would be running at the same time. A high
               point was reached in Melbourne in 1890. Messrs Williamson,
               Garner and Co. offered <i>The Gondoliers</i> at the New Princess
               Theatre and at the Theatre Royal the Company played <i>The
               English Rose</i> by R. Sims and Robert Buchanan. No expense was
               spared: "Here are real horses, a real Irish jaunting-car and a
               real stream of water flowing down the stoney channel spanned by
               the Devil Bridge."<br>
                Meanwhile, at the Opera House, Mr George Musgrove was
               presenting the Nellie Stewart Opera Company in "Paul Jones" by H
               B Farnie and Robert Planquette with Fannie Liddiard in the title
               role.

      described as being "pleasantly ample". This extraordinary woman, who was
      queen of the Australian stage for 30 years, had never received any formal
      musical training. At the height of her career her success as a public
      favourite rivalled that of Nellie Stewart. After seven years with
      Williamson she took herself off to Paris and studied under Melba's

               Historic Note:<br>
               Maggie Moore remained a favourite of the Australian stage until
               she retired in 1924. For her farewell performance she played the
               same role she had played for her first - Lizzie Stofel in <i>
               Struck Oil</i>. In 1916 she evidently acted in a film of that
               stage hit, however no copy has ever been found. After retiring
               she sailed back to San Francisco where, following a cable-car
               accident, she had a leg amputated. She died on April 15th,
               1926. In an interview about her carreer Maggie Moore said: "In my opinion the only way to make a part convincing is to feel its emotions. In a comedy part I am inwardly amused at the fun just as much as the audience is, and in a pathetic scene I feel all the sorrow. Of course these feelings have to be kept well under control, but they must be genuine, not merely simulated. An audience soon realises whetherr acting is or is not artificial or mechanical." She noted that her favourite role in Gilbert and Sullivan was Josephine.
