<img src="../pics/pixel.gif" width=15 height=1 alt="" border="0">From an Interview with J.C. Williamson: <br>
&quot;It is very</a> mysterious how a first night's verdict spreads amongst theatre-goers. I have seen the house crowded on a Saturday, and every paper on the Monday has praised the performance, yet on the Monday evening the audience will scarely half fill the house. A good criticism can help the popularity of a good performance, but it cannot bolster up a failure. Operas pay best, if they can hit the public taste, but their initial cost is very great. It would take six weeks business to crowded houses before the original outlay on the new opera is returned, and yet six weeks is counted as a long in Melbourne. I have the right to produce Sir Arthur Sullivan's Ivanhoe, but the risk is too great, until I see whether it really is popular with all classes of theatre-goers. At present it has only been played in London, where it is impossible to tell how much of its success is due merely to sumptuous mounting, excellent performances, and the prestige of novelty. I shall wait till it has been played in the provinces, in America, and in Europe. One cannot take a piece on its London success alone.&quot;</p>

The cast included Howard Vernon, Charles Ryley, and William Elton. Elton was an instant success in the role of Uncle Matt. When the work closed on April 24th Elton went off to London for an engagement. When Williamson decided to revive <i>La Cigale</i> for a further week in May he could not find anyone capable of filling Elton's shoes. Williamson recalls: &quot;'La Cigale' was announced for the Saturday night, and on the Wednesday I was still without an Uncle Matt. That night I went to the theatre and asked for the 'script'. I took it home and studied the part, and on Saturday I played it without missing a line.&quot;</p>

<a name="cary"><span class="boldletter">T</span>hroughout the 1890s there were regular revivals of the more popular of the Savoy operas as well as various others popular operettas of the day. Although many of the artists performing with J.C. Williamson stayed with the company for many years there were always one or two new faces added every year.<br>
In 1893, the tenor, Joseph Tapley was one of these new faces. Joseph commenced his professional career as a choirboy at the age of twenty. Through the kindness of Arthur Sullivan, he obtained a scholarship to study at the Albert Hall College of Music and the Guilhall Scholl of music. In 1885 he appeared in an open-air production of &quot;As You Like It&quot; and his career then took off. For the next few years he appeared in several plays and comic operas in London. He created the part of Gaston in the play &quot;The Old Guard&quot;.<p class="bodyText1">

George Lauri played Sir Joseph in this production and Joseph Tapley played Ralph.

<a name="cary"><span class="boldletter">I</span>n late 1895 there was a dearth of suitable overseas shows. The J C Williamson company was in dire straits. In desperation Williamson decided to write one himself and called in his staffer Bert Royle as collaborator and the pantomime <i>Djin Djin</i> was born. To mount the production there was a major problem - a lack of money. Williamson called the company together after a performance and gave them the bad news. After a tearful speech the entire company made a voluntary reduction of a third of their salaries. <br><i>Djin Djin</i> opened to fantastic reviews on Thursday December 26th, 1895. &quot;<i>Nothing quainter, prettier, more elaborate or more magnificent than the pantomime of Djin Djin has yet been provided in Australia by Messrs Williamson and Musgrove.</i>&quot; (The Herald) It played to capacity audiences and toured for months across Australia and New Zealand, saving the company from ruin.

It was an honest attempt by a local company to give as faithful a representation as possible to a new and comparatively unknown work. Of interest E. J. (John) Hill was in the cast. He was the brother of composer Alfred Hill, who provided an interpolated song just for this production.</p>

			<BR>Melbourne boasted the Australian premiere of Lehar's operetta <i>The Merry Widow</i> on May 16th, 1908. The operetta, which had its world premiere in Vienna in 1905, featured an exceptional cast including Florence Young, Andrew Higginson and Carrie Moore in the title role.<br>

Ms Moore had been working for J.C. Williamson since she was 12 years old. She traveled to London in 1903 to further her career and was brought back to Australia by Williamson especially for this production.<br> 
<i>The Merry Widow</i> ran for 66 nights in Melbourne. It then went to Adelaide and then to Sydney where it played for 100 nights - a record for that city.<br>
In 1909 the operetta toured New Zealand with Florence Young in the title role.
