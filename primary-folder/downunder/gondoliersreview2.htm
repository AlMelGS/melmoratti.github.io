<p class="bodyText1">

  <img src=".../../pics/pixel.gif" width=15 height=1 alt="" border="0"> 
    The large and excellent Comic Opera Company which J.C. Williamson has sent over to amuse and delight the inhabitants of this colony, made their bow to an Auckland audience, and opened their New Zealand tour in the Opera House last night receiving a welcome as enthusiastically hearty as it was thoroughly well deserved.</p> 
<p class="bodyText1">
 <img src=".../../pics/pixel.gif" width=15 height=1 alt="" border="0"> It is true that, of late, the people of this city have had an almost an operabundance of amusements submitted to them, the demands upon their patronage having been consequently numerous, but if this had been so in far greater degree there could still be little doubt with regard to the prospects of our present entertainment. With a company so strong numerically and so talented individually triumphant success must always be assured, and no matter how near to satiety the theatre-going public may have approached, their power and brilliancy is certain to prove irresistibly attractive.
</p> 
<p class="bodyText1">
 <img src=".../../pics/pixel.gif" width=15 height=1 alt="" border="0"> It is not too much to say that almost every member of the vast combination, and unquestionably, each of the principals, is an artiste in his or her own particular line, and that in every respect - musically, dramatically, and otherwise - the company is one of the best that has yet visited the colony.
The tour they have just begun will include the principal towns of New Zealand, and it may safely be assumed that, at its conclusion, the feeling throughout the length and breath of the land will be one of sincere gratitude to Mr. Williamson, and to the ladies and gentlemen whose acquaintance we owe to his enterprise. If their opening performance is a fair sample of their capabilities, Auckland and the places to be afterwards visited have, indeed, a treat in store.</p> 
<p class="bodyText1">
 <img src=".../../pics/pixel.gif" width=15 height=1 alt="" border="0">But their genuine merit is not the only claim, great as it is, which this company have upon the public. To their credit must also be added, the fact that they in their <i>repertoire</i> several famous operas never previously produced in New Zealand. In this category is the opera in which they appeared to a crowed house last night, and with which they won the unqualified admiration of their very large audience.</p> 
<p class="bodyText1">
  <img src=".../../pics/pixel.gif" width=15 height=1 alt="" border="0">&quot;The Gondoliers&quot; is the latest production of Gilbert and Sullivan, and although it is decidedly one of their best, and has attained a celebrity equal to any of its elder brothers, last night saw its first presentation on a New Zealand stage. It is almost a pity that the pleasure of hearing it has been denied us so long, but now that we have the opportunity it is our duty to ourselves to make the most of it.
</p>
   <p class="bodyText1" align="center">(There follows a  lengthy description of the musical numbers and a brief outline of the plot)</p>
 <p class="bodyText1">
 <img src=".../../pics/pixel.gif" width=15 height=1 alt="" border="0"> The interpretation of the opera by the company deserves nothing but commendation. Mr. Howard Vernon, who was accorded a most cordial reception, is in his element as the Grand Inquisitor, and acquits himself accordingly. He sings with all his customary power, and his acting is vivacious and amusingly effective.</p>
   <p class="bodyText1">
 <img src=".../../pics/pixel.gif" width=15 height=1 alt="" border="0"> Miss Graupner and Miss Varley, both of whom are new to the colony, are really excellent as Gianetta and Tessa. These ladies sing sweetly and dance with nimble grace, and would be a valuable acquisition to any comic opera company.</p>
   <p class="bodyText1">
 <img src=".../../pics/pixel.gif" width=15 height=1 alt="" border="0"> Miss Elsie Cameron and Miss Florence Young, also strangers to New Zealand, appear as the Duchess and her daughter respectively, and make the most of their music and parts.</p>
   <p class="bodyText1">
<img src=".../../pics/pixel.gif" width=15 height=1 alt="" border="0"> The Gondoliers are represented by Messrs. Henry Bracy and Sydney Deane, and both gentlemen have, by their first appearance here last night, already won their way to public favour by the merits of their performances.</p>
   <p class="bodyText1">
 <img src=".../../pics/pixel.gif" width=15 height=1 alt="" border="0">  Mr. George Lauri is admirably suited as the Duke, and besides singing well, dances most gracefully. The part of Luiz, the rightful Monarch of Barataria, is judiciously entrusted to Mr. William Rosevear, and other characters have suitable representatives.</p>
   <p class="bodyText1">
<img src=".../../pics/pixel.gif" width=15 height=1 alt="" border="0">
The chorus is powerful and excellently trained, and a most efficient orchestra is under the able directorship of Mr. Leon Caron, and with all the attractions already named, there are also those of charming dresses, appropriate scenery, and appointments that are perfectly complete.</p>
   <p class="bodyText1">
<img src=".../../pics/pixel.gif" width=15 height=1 alt="" border="0">
    <br>In short the opera is one of the best emanations from the Gilbert-Sullivan authorship, and is treated by the Williamson company according to its deserts.
