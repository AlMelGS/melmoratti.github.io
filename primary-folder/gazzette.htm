<BR><FONT COLOR="#FF00FF">PETE BELASCO Get It Together (Universal)</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#FF00FF">Very rarely will you find an album this hot that
combines soul &amp; jazz; Pete Belasco has done just that. &quot;Get It Together&quot;
is faintly reminiscent of George Michael's &amp; Michael Frank's dreamy,
soulful vocals with a dash of Georgie Fame's famous organ style thrown
richin. Sade lovers' will enjoy the silky smoothness of &quot;Love Train&quot;. Th
blends of saxophones, organ &amp; soft vocals create an ambience that is
almost unique to Belasco. Sit back with your coffee and let this sexy album
wash over you. <I>Gazz</I></FONT>

<BR><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">RENEE GEYER Sweet Life (BMG)</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">If in-case I had forgotten how strong and mesmerising
the smouldering emotion of Renee Geyer's husky voice is. The album 'Sweet
Life', not only reminded me once more that Geyer who was hailed in the
70's as Australia's First Lady of Soul/Funk was and still is one of the
finest voices that will ever grace my album collection. From the first
track Geyer's exceptional voice will draw you in, I turned up the volume,
poured a good $10.00 Red and joined in all the choruses.</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">There
are 10 original tracks and a good cover of, 'I'm Gonna Make You Love Me'.
The most impressive aspect of this album is that four of the most powerful
songs on the album Geyer wrote herself, illustrating an emerging talent
that possibly derives inspiration from her songwriter friend Paul Kelly,
who co-produced this album with Joe Camilleri and has written and produced
some great numbers for Renee Geyer on this album and previously on the
CD, 'Difficult Woman', which he also produced. <I>Carole Ritchie <A HREF="http://www.reneegeyer@aol.com">http://www.reneegeyer@aol.com</A></I></FONT>

<BR><FONT COLOR="#800080">KAREN RAMIREZ Distant Dreams (Universal)</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#800080">Anyone who has ever purchased &quot;Caf&eacute; Del
Mar Cuatro&quot; (Cuatro is Spanish for four) would have heard the delightful
vocals of Karen Ramirez. She reminds me of Sade &amp; Anita Baker. Karen
opens with the Latin flavoured &quot;Trouble Girl&quot;, that has sad &amp; deep
meaningful lyrics. Next comes a little drum�n�bass with &quot;More Than Words
Can Say&quot;. &quot;Stormy Day&quot; is a dreamy number that seems to float on forever.
&quot;Lies&quot; is one of the longest songs on &quot;Distant Dreams&quot; and is the key dance
track. Enter the Anita Baker sound alike with &quot;If We Try&quot;. &quot;New Reality&quot;
is a song Sade should record! &quot;Looking For Love&quot; is the second single from
&quot;Distant Dreams&quot; that has a strong Summer flavour. &quot;Maker Shaker&quot; is both
strange &amp; deep. &quot;Wings&quot; should be a single with its funky pop melody.
&quot;People Make The World Go Around&quot; is a Stylistics classic &amp; one of
my favourites! Original cover wasn't available for this publication so
we have included the Japanese album cover instead. <I>&quot;Distant Dreams&quot;</I>
is a great debut album from Karen Ramirez and all I can pray for is MORE!

<BR>Tori Amos From The Choirgirl Hotel (Warner)
<BR>I've had a soft spot for the quirky red headed piano player- singer/songwriter
ever since hearing the single &quot;Silent All These Years&quot; from her Little
Earthquakes album. Now Tori Amos has made a very classy, more contemporary
record than any of her previous efforts to date. One can never be sure
whether she's playful girl next door or avenging angel! What ever it is,
she's passionate and animated in her devotion to her subject. From the
prickly self doubt of &quot;Spark&quot; to affirmations of strength to the suffering
in &quot;Black Dove(January)&quot;,Tori wends her way through a gambit of emotions.
&quot;Black Dove (January)&quot; and another song called &quot;Playboy Mommy&quot; seem to make
allusions to the loss of a child. There are the usual references to the
illusions of love and happiness in songs like &quot;Jackie's Strength&quot;, &quot;Hotel&quot;
and &quot;Northern Lad&quot;. Tori abandons the minimalist approach of 1996s Boys
For Pele for a more industrial sound on From The Choirgirl Hotel. With
a lacing of ballads like the beautifully orchestrated &quot;Black Dove (January)&quot;.
From The Choirgirl Hotel is produced by Tori and she provides some great
piano work here in. It's difficult to pick favourite tracks as each one
has something to offer. Kate Bush still seems to have an influence in Tori's
vocal style, especially on the driving &quot;She's Your Cocaine&quot;. There's no
doubt that Tori Amos is still able to create inventive and thought provoking
music of a standard consistent with any of her past work. <I>Micheil Reid</I>
<BR><IMG SRC="Image16.gif" HEIGHT=200 WIDTH=200>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">The Pretenders Viva El Amor! (Warner)</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">It's a gritty, riff driven rock� n' roll album
from the Diva of rock, Chrissie Hynde and The Pretenders. Chock full of
jangley guitars and memorable melodies. There's a great live feeling to
this collection of recordings, keeping a balance between pop/ rock tunes
and ballads. Check out the catchy &quot;From the Heart Down&quot; a pretty love song.
Buffeting the more riffy tunes like &quot;Popstar&quot; the album opener and my favourite,
&quot;Legalise Me&quot;. Another memorable moment is the Spanish sounding &quot;Rabo De
Nube&quot; a gentle ballad which for me paints romantic pictures of summer beaches
and sunsets. Of course the lyrics, when translated may not at all resemble
the image this song conjures for me. &quot;One More Time&quot; is a cool sixties
soul styled song that's worth a listen. Chrissie Hynde's vocals are as
confident as ever while the lyric content deals with the usual conflict
of relationships and domestic strife, to../pics with which we've become familiar
on previous Pretenders albums. Guitarist Jeff Beck makes an appearance
on this record, while Stephen Hague and Stephen Street divide up the production
duties. It's remarkable that after so many years of making records The
Pretenders can still pull out an album as constant as anything they've
done in the past, with the exception, perhaps, of Pretenders 1. It has
the same grit and determination as say, their Learning to Crawl or Get
Close albums. It's a lot better than some new albums by some old rock bands
I could mention. <I>Micheil Reid</I></FONT>

<P>THE VENTURES Another Smash/The Ventures/ Surfing/The Colourful Ventures/
Twist With The Ventures/Twist Party Vol.2/ Mashed Potatoes &amp; Gravy/Dance
Party (One Way Records)
<BR>The Ventures were one of the first and most influential of the guitar/bass/drums
rock combos that proliferated the airways in the early sixties, (rivalled
only by England�s Shadows). Formed in Seattle by Bob Bogle and Don Wilson,
they recruited guitarist Nokie Edwards and drummer Howie Johnston. In 1959
they recorded the classic &quot;Walk Don�t Run&quot;, which became a world wide hit.
Throughout the 60�s, The Ventures were huge, particularly in Japan and
Europe, where the instrumental rock hits easily found a wanting audience,
(no lyrics). Now, available on CD are the original albums on a &quot;2 on 1&quot;
format with bonus tracks. The guitar rock instrumental has made a comeback
in recent years, Quinten Taratino used Link Wray�s &quot;Rumble&quot; &amp; &quot;Jack
The Ripper&quot;, and Dick dale�s surf classic &quot;Misirlou&quot; on the soundtracks
to &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; &amp; &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot;. Any budding guitarist could do
worse than listen to the licks in these re-releases from a classic instrumental
group of the 60�s. <I>Norm Booker</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#8000FF">JOSE PADILLA Souvenir (Universal)</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#8000FF">Jose Padilla is the musical wizard who is responsible
for compiling the <I>&quot;Cafe Del Mar&quot;</I> series. Opening <I>&quot;Souvenir&quot; </I>is<I>
</I>&quot;Orientation&quot; that arouses memories of Cirque Du Soleil and Mark Isham�s
earlier works. &quot;Orientation&quot; has a interesting bass rhythm that creeps
in after a couple of minutes. &quot;I Like Clowns&quot; has appeared on a <I>&quot;Cafe
Del Mar&quot;</I> album and is a journey into minimalism. &quot;Who Do You Love&quot;
is a beautiful melody with a Latin flavour. &quot;Blues For Ibiza&quot; has a truly
melancholy atmosphere that is generated by Dave �Blues� Jeffs� harmonica
and guitar resonance. The Spanish influenced &quot;Bossa Rosa&quot; features flamenco
guitarist Paco Fernandez and trumpeter Nathan Bray. &quot;Colega&quot; absolutely
reeks of very enticing Middle Eastern haunting percussion. &quot;Alive&quot; features
the warm, sensual vocals of Angela John. &quot;Train To Nottingham&quot; is quiteambient,
that is reminiscent of Vangelis instrumentals. &quot;After The Dance&quot; is a sexy
jazz instrumental that has a sixties type ski-fi theme running through
it. The Bacharach classic &quot;Close To You&quot;, that was made famous by The Carpenters
is included here and is given a Spanish face-lift. Concluding <I>&quot;Souvenir&quot;</I>
is<FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=+1> </FONT></FONT>&quot;La Mer (The Sea)&quot; that
is a gentle composition that sums up Jose�s passion for Ibiza. <I>Gazz</I></FONT>

<BR>TOMMY CASTRO Right As Rain (Border)
<BR>&quot;Right As Rain&quot; opens with the brassy R&amp;B &quot;Lucky In Love&quot;, then
moves into the Memphis soul sound of &quot;Like An Angel&quot;. The title track &amp;
&quot;Just A Man&quot; send me flashbacks of the great vocal style of Delbert McClinton.
For a white man Tommy is gifted with a delightful black voice &amp; this
comes to the fore with the Wilson Pickett influenced &quot;Don�t Turn Your Heater
Down&quot; that features vocalist Delbert McClinton, with Dr John on organ.
&quot;I�ve Got To Love Somebody�s Baby&quot; is pure soul &amp; features Dr John
on piano. &quot;If I Had A Nickel&quot; is reminiscent of the early Savoy Brown (one
of my favourite UK blues bands). &quot;Callin� San Francisco&quot; &amp; &quot;Kickin�
In&quot; are both quite jazzy. There will be no doubting Tommy�s talent for
executing great guitar licks after you have heard his chord changes during
&quot;Chairman Of The Board&quot;. &quot;Right As Rain&quot; is soul/blues at it�s very best!

<BR>SUSAN TEDESCHI Just Won�t Burn (Elite)
<BR>Susan launches into the rockabilly &quot;Rock Me Right&quot; from base one that
features the joint guitar wizardry of Sean Costello &amp; herself. &quot;You
Need To Be With Me&quot; is a Tedeschi original &amp; sounds like a young Bonnie
Raitt. One of my favourite Junior Wells songs &quot;Little By Little&quot; is given
a face-lift and features Annie Raines on harmonica. &quot;Looking For Answers&quot;
shows off a beautiful, moody side of Susan and also showcases her wicked
slide guitar playing. Susan�s rhythm guitarist Adrienne Hayes, who has
recorded with Ronnie Earl, wrote &quot;Can�t Leave You Alone&quot;. Adrienne is not
only a great songwriter; she also plays dynamic lead on &quot;Can�t Leave You
Alone&quot;. The title track is total soul! Next comes 2 classics, &quot;Mama, He
Treats Your Daughter Mean&quot; &amp; Prine�s &quot;Angel From Montgomery&quot; that are
both welcome inclusions on &quot;Just Won�t Burn&quot; that showcase the depth and
the range of this delightful blues woman. Some real pure blues rounds of
this great album with &quot;Friars Point&quot; that was co-written by Susan�s drummer
Tom Hambridge. <I>Gazz</I>

<BR><FONT COLOR="#000080">MARIA MULDAUR Meet Me Where They Play The Blues
(Elite)</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000080">Maria�s voice is her trademark. Most of you would
have heard the Maria�s &quot;Midnight At The Oasis&quot; that became a 70�s classic.
Maria opens with the soft, Southern soul approach during Joe Green�s &quot;Soothe
Me&quot;. &quot;I wanna Be Loved&quot; is pure jazz cabaret. Featured on &quot;Gee Baby, Ain�t
I Good To You&quot; is the legendary Charles Brown, and this may have been the
last studio recording that Charles was involved with as he died not too
long after. &quot;It Ain�t The Meat, It�s The Motion&quot; leaves you with no doubt
what this song is all about. The title track is pure New Orleans blues.
John Hiatt lovers will enjoy this rendition of John�s &quot;It Feels Like Rain&quot;,
Maria performs it in such a way that takes you way down south. &quot;Blues So
Bad&quot; was written by Levon Helm (The Band) &amp; anyone would think it had
been written especially for Maria. One of the down &amp; out songs on this
album is &quot;Misery &amp; The Blues&quot;. Maria performs &quot;He Don�t Have The Blues
Anymore&quot; as a tribute to Johnny Adams &amp; Charles Brown. Both are noted
for their contribution to the Louisiana music scene. &quot;All To Myself Alone&quot;
is one of my favourite blues songs that I remember hearing Ray Charles
performing when I was very young. As farewell tribute to Charles Brown
Maria loses &quot;Meet Me Where They Play The Blues&quot; with Charles� own song
&quot;The Promised Land&quot;. This album is very melancholy, and also very well
recorded. With it�s many moods it will fill some gap in your collection.

<BR><FONT COLOR="#808080">ETTA JAMES Life, Love &amp; The Blues (BMG)</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#808080">Etta is famous for her renditions of &quot;I�d Rather
Go Blind&quot;, &quot;Tell Mama&quot; and &quot;At Last&quot;. In 1994 she made a comeback with
&quot;Mystery Lady&quot; that was a beautiful jazz tribute to Billie Holiday. Now
she is back in the blues with <I>&quot;Life, Love &amp; The Blues&quot;</I> , and
Al Green�sEtta opens with Booker. T�s &quot;Born Under A Bad Sign&quot; that growls
&quot;Here I Am&quot; and Marvin Gaye�s &quot;Inner City Blues&quot; showcase the soulful side
of Etta�s voice. Etta then belts out Willie Dixon�s &quot;Spoonful&quot; &amp; &quot;Hoochie
Coochie Gal&quot;, that even challenges Koko Taylor�s and Muddy Water�s renditions.
Etta tells us just how much love you need to save your relationship during
Joe Tex�s &quot;The Love You Save May Be Your Own&quot;. Etta saves the best for
last with Brook Benton�s &quot;I�ll Take Care Of You&quot;, and this really shows
off the heart of this amazing woman. My personal favourite track on &quot;Life,
Love &amp; The Blues&quot; is Johnny �Guitar� Watson�s &quot;I Want To Ta Ta You
Baby&quot; that is pure malt whiskey! This is Etta�s greatest album yet! <I>Gazz</I></FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#3333FF">BRAD MEHLDAU Elegant Cycle (Warner Brothers)</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#3333FF">State of the play from the top New York pianist.
This solo debut from the thinking bard of modern jazz is both plaintive
and profound. There are some big themes here; romanticism, history, lament.
All are united under the heading of Memory-collective and personal. �Bard�
(read Brad), which opens and closes the album, states and summarises the
themes while �Lament For Linus� neatly recaps Mehldau�s Art Of The Trio
series, recently completed. Each track stands alone but, like the cycle
of the title, the sweep and the depth is best appreciated if regarded as
a whole. This is a seamless journey through early-modern space and time-passionately
executed-and with not a little New York irony! Skilful, intense, thoughtful.
Its all here. Highly recommended.</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF6600">FRED HERSH &amp; BILL FRISELL Songs We Know (Warner)</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#FF6600">Any project that Bill Frisell graces with his
presence will have humour and wit-the guitarist�s �pacific� style is legendary.
Somewhat more constrained here, the narrative duties of these familiar
standards is evenly shared with the pianist. Variously successful, harmonics
and (their) dynamics have a lot to do with the sound. The choice of notes
(and sounds) communicate an honest and simple approach. The two clearly
respect their material and the result is spontaneous and relaxed. &quot;Blue
Monk&quot; opens and proceeds with its own momentum. It is a joy. �Wave� is
a paean to its composer and �It Might As Well Be Spring� should be released
as a single! Otherwise, the common knowledge of these songs allows the
listener to enjoy both the familiar and the particular arrangement. Two
talented friends enjoying themselves. Recommended.</FONT>

their &quot;streetfunkjazzdub&quot; sounds across the globe since 1993. Their 1995
debut album for RCA, &quot;Cool, Steady and Easy,&quot; was critically acclaimed

reggae and ska has won a following which cuts across demographic lines
even as it sets a standard for acid -jazz. At the urging of legendary Atlantic

for a huge concert and recorded In The Buzz Bag in collaboration with some

Hollywood; 120 seats)</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#FF8040">By Phil Gallo</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#FF8040">HOLLYWOOD (Variety) - The approach is not unlike
that of a major league hitter who likes fastballs on the first pitch: the
action is immediate and the results often scintillating, the rare breathtaking
moment in a baseball game. The alto saxophonist Kenny Garrett stood sideways
to audience, whispered a count and bam! Like hitter smacking the ball toward
the bleachers, he and the band were off and running with abandon for 15
minutes on Herbie Hancock's ``One Finger Snap.'' Having come to prominence
in one of Miles Davis' later bands, Garrett, a consistent poll winner for
his alto saxophone playing, is a fireball in a live setting. On his recent
Warner Bros. outing, ``Simply Said,'' and the handful that preceded it,
by contrast, he stresses melody and coherence, venturing into the light
side of rap, funk and the music of John Coltrane. On this, the second set
of the second night, Garrett displayed a wondrous sense of invention as
he tackled Coltrane's ``Giant Steps'' with far more intensity than he did
on record, venturing unaccompanied with focus intact and showcasing his
band, particularly the light touch of pianist Nick Smith. Venturing into
his own compositions, Garrett began to simmer on numbers such as ``Charlie
Brown Goes to South Africa,'' which is exactly that -- Vince Guaraldi with
funky poly-rhythms -- and his spin on beat poetry, ``Back Where You Started.''
Garrett's key foil is drummer Marcus Baylor, who kept time within a flurry
of patterns that were sometimes too sprawling for the music while his solos
were welcome flights of hard-nosed drumming. But the evening got an added
spark when ace trumpeter Roy Hargrove approached the stage from the side
and began a duel with Garrett that continued through the final three numbers.
Hargrove clearly pushed Garrett without upstaging him, a demonstration
of the rewards only jazz can deliver when the musical environment is perfect.

<P>ROLF JARDEMARK - Biography
<BR>&quot;Jardemark is unable to resist his need to play jazz&quot; - writes a critic
from the British <i>Jazz Journal</i>: After listening to the CD <i>Guitarland</i>
most everyone is inclined to agree. In the Danish 'Special Jazz' you find:
&quot;Jardemark plays 'real' jazz guitar and has a delightful and warm sound&quot;.
Rolf Jardemark, born 1960 in Gothenburg, Sweden. Picked up the guitar around
the age of twelve. After a few years of self studies he enrolled at music
high school. The lively jazz scene of Gothenburg, with musicians as e.g.
guitarist Ulf Wakenius and the jazz club &quot;Artdur&quot; (now renamed &quot;Nefertiti&quot;),
made a strong impression. In 1977 Jardemark and fellow guitarist Per Hovensj&ouml;
founded a duo, still active today. After graduating from Gothenburg College
of Music in 1985, Jardemark has been seen in many different musical constellations;
such as jazz-rock groups, big bands, and &quot;acid jazz.&quot; Rolf Jardemark has
recorded and performed together with Lars Danielsson, Erik Norstr&ouml;m,
Michael Ruff, Bohusl&auml;n Big Band, Nils Landgren, David Wilczewski,
Al Harewood, Nils-Bertil Dahlander (Bert Dale), to name a few. Jardemark
has played most of the jazz clubs in Sweden, both with his own group and
as a side man. He appeared with Rune Gustafsson on the nationally televised
show &quot;Jazzduellen&quot; (The Jazz Duel) in 1994. The collaboration with Gustafsson
has continued since, both with a quartet and with Bohusl&auml;n Big Band.
Rolf Jardemark has released the following solo albums: Soft Landing (Liphone
LICD 3095), Jungle Crunch (Imogena CD 027), and Guitarland (IGCD 044).
The latter with Lars Danielsson on bass, and Anders Kjellberg on drums.
&quot;Guitarland&quot; received great reviews both in Sweden and abroad. Jardemark&acute;s
new CD &quot;Further Adventures in Guitarland&quot; (Imogena CD 067) was released
in -97 with Yasuhito Mori on bass, and Terje Sundby on drums. Guest appearances
on some cuts by Thomas Gustafsson on saxophone, and Erik Gullbransson vocals.
In addition to his own group, Jardemark is also a member of Jan Zirk Quartet.
String Jazz, Nov 1996 - Five Stars. Considering the size of the country
(or maybe the size of population), Sweden keeps on producing some fine
jazz guitarists. From the superb Rune Gustafsson through to Ulf Wakenius
and Peter Almqvist and now a new name - that of Rolf Jardemark. Jardemark
comes from the school of Wes Montgomery, Kenny Burrell and Pat Martino
and you can heartraces of of each of these fine players on this CD (Burrell
on Linneus, Wes of course on Four on Six and Martino particularly on There&acute;s
no greater love). But Jardemark is his own man (you might expect this with
the above mentioned as his spiritual mentors) - tasteful, melodic, always
probing. From the hard edged post bop of No Time to Waste, he sinks into
a fine finger-style rendition of the lovely In a sentimental mood. With
the rock solid and swinging supprt of the superb bassist Lars Danielsson
and drummer Anders Kjellberg, Jardemark shows on this CD that Europe has
produced yet another fine jazz guitarist in the mainstream tradition. A

<BR><FONT COLOR="#800000">Stern guitar lessons</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#800000">Mike Stern returns to the straightahead work
he demonstrated on Standards (1992) and, like that record, he proves again
that he�s one of the most imaginative and exciting of contemporary guitarists.
He�s already shown that he�s more than a match for most of the fire-breathing
fusion guitar players out there, but he doesn�t relax or retreat on this
album. The eleven cuts feature seven originals and covers of Coltrane (&quot;Giant
Steps&quot;), Hendrix (&quot;Who Knows&quot;) and the bebop standard &quot;Oleo.&quot; Tellingly,
the two ballads, &quot;Everything Changes&quot; and &quot;Rooms,&quot; are particularly fine.
He�s got stellar company on this session: drummer Jack DeJohnette swinging
his butt off, John Patitucci playing upright bass only, and guest appearances
that sound like a reunion of Berklee Class of �80-something: Michael Brecker,
David Sanborn and Gil Goldstein. Stern�s got a richly chorused tone that
could be overdone in the wrong hands, but comes off as a singular and absolutely
correct voice in his hands. You have to dig the way he gets right to the
point of a song, then starts to bend and hammer to get the outside notes
when he solos. This guy has chops, no doubt about it. But he comes across
to casual listeners, too. I was playing this album at work and a woman
stopped by to hear more. She�s not usually a jazz fan, but she dug this
music. A lot of guitarists know about Mike Stern. This record will let
them know that he can�t be typecast as a fusion slinger and he�s certainly
not one of the Joe Pass wannabees. It should also introduce him to a wider
audience who will dig his sound and his songs. He deserves it.�Gerry Lenocker

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">&nbsp;PLAYING BY HEART/original soundtrack album
(Universal)</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">&quot;No matter how many times one has done it--and
I've done over 80 pictures now--it doesn't make any difference: the most
favourite part is when you've finished writing in detail for several weeks
and you have maybe an hour's music that nobody's ever really heard before--except
for bits and pieces--and then you go into the studio at 10 o'clock on Monday
morning or whatever it is. There are 70 or 80 of the finest musicians.
You bring the baton down and this thing starts to come to life. It's the
best feeling. That and sex, and I don't know which comes first.&quot; So said
British film composer John Barry--born in York but long a resident of New
York--a couple of years back. I'd bet that the position hasn't changed.
Famous for his lush, sweeping (and Oscar-winning) scores for films such
as &quot;Out of Africa&quot; and &quot;Dances With Wolves,&quot; Barry's original fondness
for jazz has deeply influenced efforts like &quot;The Cotton Club,&quot; &quot;Body Heat,&quot;
and more lately Barry's soundtrack for the IMAX film &quot;Across the Sea of
Time.&quot; Latest out is another movie track, that for &quot;Playing By Heart,&quot;
an interesting-sounding 1990s relationships piece with a definitely interesting
cast. Included are Sean Connery, Gena Rowlands, Gillian Anderson, Dennis
Quaid and Madeleine Stowe. This is also an album with crossover appeal
to a jazz audience--especially fans of legendary trumpeter Chet Baker who
sounds superb in three astonishingly restored standards: &quot;Tenderly,&quot; &quot;You
Go To My Head'&quot; and &quot;These Foolish Things.&quot; These were taped in Paris,
1956. As for the orchestral cues, they are quintessentially John Barry
at his very best--perfectly arranged, extremely atmospheric in a wistfully
romantic mode and, yes, sexy. &quot;John Barry connects with the film in a very
personal way,&quot; says writer-director Willard Carroll, wisely pressing the
point: &quot;You can only talk about the music so far and then your gut has
to take over.&quot; <I>Mark Knowles</I></FONT>

<BR><FONT COLOR="#663300">Updating Shakespeare�s play of adolescent love
to Tuscany at the turn of the century opens up the work to a time and period
where opera was the main form of relaxation. The soundtrack album comes
as a more general opera collection than an original score recording. Drawn
from the vast Decca catalogue the voices of Luciano Pavarotti and Ren&eacute;e
Fleming mix and mingle with a lush and slightly quirky score by Simon Boswell.
Combining elements and instruments from ancient traditions he has assembled
an appealing score that grows on rehearing. A shame all is spoilt by the
opera tracks, which tend to pull the listener away from the beauty of the
original music. So who would buy the CD? Lovers of the film? Yes. Lovers
of opera? Hardly. Lovers of film music? Maybe. Lovers of Simon Boswell?

Paris.</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#663300">Elegant and inventive, the works are much influenced
by Brazilian folksong, yet they adhere to tradition by each having four
movements apiece. Apparently simple, the development becomes rich and complex.
Each blooms with colour and rhythm and the Cuarteto Latinamericano are
obviously passionate about their material. The recording is both crisp
and airy. The sound might be a little too close for some tastes, but it
does serve to highlight the vibrant textures of the music.</FONT>

opening work &quot;Young Apollo&quot; is a delight with some catchy syncopated playing

a lot of romantic wallowing by the two soloists. The Two Portraits are

<BR><FONT COLOR="#800080">No one will argue that Greenwich Village is still
the centre of musical civilisation, as it appeared to be in the early to
mid-60s. However, there remains a vital scene in New York�s once-thriving
folk mecca, thanks to a number of talented artists who are keeping the
heritage alive. This one-disc compilation honours the singers and songwriters
who started the folk revival - Pete Seeger, Bob Dylan, Simon &amp; Garfunkel,
Phil Ochs, Judy Collins, Leonard Cohen, and the other usual suspects -
with covers of songs written by and/or associated with them. The participants
range from &quot;neo-folk&quot; figures like Jonatha Brooke, Suzanne Vega, Loudon
Wainwright III, and Iris DeMent to rockers Chrissie Hynde, Black 47, and
Marshall Crenshaw. Highlights include the Wainwright/ DeMent duet &quot;Pack
Up Your Sorrows&quot; (originally by Richard &amp; Mimi Farifia), Black 47�s
feisty reading of the Ochs anthem &quot;I Ain�t Marchin� Anymore&quot;, Ron Sexsmith�s
version of Tim Hardin�s &quot;Reason To Believe&quot;, and John Cale�s take on Cohen�s
&quot;So Long, Marianne&quot;, which features vocals by Vega. A contemporary look

<BR><B><I>The Fifth Element</I></B>
<BR>Director; Luc Besson.
<BR>Producer; Columbia Pictures/ Gaumont. Running time; 123 mins aprox.
<BR>DVD video, Region 4
<BR>Luc Besson takes us on a roller coaster come magic carpet ride in this
snappy, inventive movie. Lavished with inspired special effects and driven
by a well conceived plot, The Fifth Element is a wrapping full of action
and atmosphere. Drawing it's images from movies like Blade Runner and Star
Wars. Bruce Willis (Pulp Fiction, 12 Monkeys) plays a down and out cab
driver in the twenty-third century that in the course of a normal day encounters
the Supreme Being, Leeloo, played by Milla Jovovich (Return to the Blue
Lagoon, Chaplin, Dazed and Confused). She's a stunning, sexy red head who
in the process of saving the world, manages to get herself into as much
trouble as Korben Dallas, the character Willis plays. Populated with wicked
aliens( cleverly created by some brilliant special effects) and evil geniuses
like Zorg, the crazed, power hungry business tycoon played exquisitely
By Garry Oldman (The Professional, Lost In Space). There are allusions
to Indiana Jones here in the movies opening scenes and moments of true
tongue firmly in cheek comedy. Eric Serra provides a superb soundtrack,
enhancing a mix of rock with classical music. It's worth while checking
out especially for the inclusion of an aria from Gaetano Donizetti's &quot;Lucia
di Lammermorr&quot; performed by Diva Plava Laguna, played by Mawenn Le Besco.
The Diva's vocals performed by Inva Mulla Tchanko, accompanied by the London
Symphony Orchestra. It's one of my favourite moments in the movie and on
the soundtrack album. The DVD format of this film is second to none. Crisp,
clear picture quality in tandem with rich, vibrant sound. Plenty of rumble!
If you like you can go to the language menu and select the French language
option and hear the dialogue in French while reading English subtitles.
Also the credits scroll up in French in the opening sequence. Take it from
me, this movie is well worth spending forty odd dollars on. <I>Micheil

<BR><B><I>Dark City</I></B>
<BR>Director; Alex Proyas, Released by New Line Cinema, Distributed by
Village Roadshow, Region 4 DVD
<BR>Alex Proyas directs a competent cast in a chilling psychological thriller:
A mystery, of mind boggling proportions.
<BR>John Murdoch,played by Rufus Sewell (Hamlet) wakes up in a bath with
no memory of where he's been or what he�s done. He finds himself embroiled
in a murder mystery in which he�s the principle suspect.&nbsp; Living in
a city cloaked in perpetual darkness he&nbsp; unravels a past both perplexing
and haunting. William Hurt, (Lost In Space, The Accidental Tourist) plays
the hard nosed Inspector Frank Bumstead, charged with solving the murders
and bringing in the bad guy,&nbsp; lead in a chase full of twists and turns
that culminate in a very strange conclusion indeed. Drooling with atmosphere
and an intriguing plot, Hurt and Sewell are joined by Kiefer Sutherland
(The Three Musketeers, A Time To Kill) who plays the sinister Dr. Daniel
Poe Schreber and Jennifer Connelly (Labyrinth, Mulholland Falls) who is
Murdoch�s wife. All this is played out amongst �the Strangers�, who�s dark
purpose is unknown to the&nbsp; city�s inhabitants, who, in a night, might
live a whole life unaware of their true predicament.
<BR>This DVD comes as an excellent transfer, crisp picture quality, despite
the fact that much of the action takes place in almost darkness. There
is no colour bleeding and suffers virtually no back ground graininess in
the dark, city street scenes. Lavished with a stunning soundtrack (Check
out the performance of �The Night Has A Thousand Eyes� in the nightclub
sequence, it�s a treat! <I>Micheil Reid</I>
