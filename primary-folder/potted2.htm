<img src="../pics/pixel.gif" width=15 height=1 alt="" border="0">Historic Note: <br>After Sullivan's death there were very few performances of the Cello Concerto.

<img src="../pics/pixel.gif" width=15 height=1 alt="" border="0">Historic Note: <br>With all the hurry in writing and rehearsing, Gilbert forgot to consider carefully what he should be getting paid for doing the work. After the play opened he was asked what fee he was expecting. As <i>Fun</i> payed &pound;1 per column Gilbert calculated the fee to be 30 guineas. Although the figure was reasonable he was knocked down to 30 pounds. Gilbert accepted, whereupon he was told never to take so little for a piece so good. He never did again.<br>

LADY M.: Is it possible? And you?<br>

SIR C.:  I'm a Michael Angelo. A very fine example, painted by him five years before I came, quite unexpectedly, into possession of this castle, and six years before his death. I'm worth at least as much as you. Indeed, I'm a much finer picture.<br>
