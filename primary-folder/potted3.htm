The original production had the part of Hollering played by a woman, Maria Simpson. His brothers played their characters <i>en travestied</i> which were the rule in burlesque. The play ran until April, went on tour, and then lay dormant until it was revived as <i>Princess Ida</i>.

&quot;It afforded, however, a curious example of the manner in which the Censorship of those days dealt with plays submitted to it for licence. It seems that it was the custom of the then Licence of Plays to look through the MS. of a new piece, and strike out all irreverent words, substituting for them words of an inoffensive character. In <i>Great Expectations</i>, Magwitch, the returned convict, had to say to Pip: 'Here you are, in the chambers fit for a Lord.' The MS. was returned to the theatre with the word 'Lord' struck out, and 'Heaven' substituted, in pencil!&quot;.
