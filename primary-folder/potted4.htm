He said, Damn me!' I cannot find words to convey to the reader the pain I felt in seeing these dear children taught to utter such words to amuse ears grown callous to their ghastly meaning. Put the two ideas side by side - Hell (no matter whether you believe in it or not; millions do) and those pure young lips thus sporting with its horrors - and then find what fun in it you can! How Mr Gilbert could have stooped to write, or Arthur Sullivan could have prostituted his noble art set to music, such vile trash, it passes my skill to understand.&quot; <br><i>Lewis Carroll</i>
