His answer surprised everyone. &quot;There is no place,&quot; he said, &quot;where I have so many inspirations as in a railway carriage. there is something in the rapidity of the motion; in the clanging of the iron, and the wheels, which seems to excite the imagination, and supplies material for a host of strange harmonies.&quot;
