It would be surprising indeed if under such circumstances &quot;The Mikado&quot; which now attracts throngs to the Savoy Theatre, should not be received in this country with sufficient favor to warrant a prediction of its pretty durable success. Contrary to somewhat general belief, last evening's performance did not cast any new light upon the excellences of the libretto or upon the comparative weakness of the music.&quot; <br><i>New York Times of 20 August 1885</i><br></p>

That no fewer than nine numbers were encored, and that two of them were sung three times, is emphatic testimony of the favour with which the opera was received by the immense audience; and this favour will, it is believed, increase rather than diminish when, after a certain familiarity with the whole, there is opportunity for examining the details more than is possible when the eye and ear are strained to the utmost.&quot; <br><i>Sydney Morning Herald.

Hundreds of letters and telegrams inundated his bedroom from the Prince of Wales down to the Savoyard in the street. Grossmith had such a following that a lot of people stayed away from the operetta until he returned. His understudy, H.A.

<img src="../pics/pixel.gif" width=15 height=1 alt="" border="0">Newspaper Review: <br>&quot;It is quite out of place to compare it to the other Gilbert-Sullivan operas, for Sir Arthur Sullivan has evidently set himself to create a new style, with probably a tendency to grand opera. And this tendency is more noticeable in the orchestration than in any other part of the music. Throughout the opera the instrumentation charms the ear into an almost total disregard of the efforts of the vocalists, and if it were possible to give the whole of the orchestral music of The Yeomen of the Guard as a kind of symphony without reference to performers or plot, the effort would be highly agreeable, for the real beauties of the work lie in the orchestration, which is at once tenderly melodious and yet vividly dramatic.&quot; <br><i>Table Talk, Melbourne.

D'Oyly Carte ensured The Savoy�s continued success by luring celebrated hotelier Cesar Ritz from Paris to be Manager. Ritz was accompanied by M&acirc;itre Chef Auguste Escoffier who created unique dishes for Sarah Bernhardt, Lily Langtry, Dame Nellie Melba and the Prince of Wales, later Edward VII.
