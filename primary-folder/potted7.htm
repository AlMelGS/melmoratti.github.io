&quot;I have had a difficulty with Carte. I was appalled to learn from him that the preliminary expenses of the <i>Gondoliers</i> amounted to the stupendous sum of &pound;4,500!!! This seemed so utterly unaccountable that I asked to see the details and last night I received a resum&eacute; of them. This includes such trifles as &pound;75 for Miss Moore's second dress - &pound;50 for her first dress - &pound;100 for Miss Brandram's second dress (this costly garment has now, for some occult reason, been sent on tour); &pound;450 for wages of the carpenters during the time they were engaged on the scenery: &pound;460 for the gondola, the sailing boat, the two columns and the two chairs and fountain for Act 2; &pound;112 for timber, &pound;120 for ironmongery, &pound;95 for canvas - and so forth. But the most surprising item was &pound;500 for new carpets <i>for the front of the house!</i>&quot;

It may, indeed, be doubted whether the older collaborators would have followed their own example so closely as their successors have done.<br>
The opera was received with every sign of favour, many numbers having to be repeated, and the author and composer, as well as Mr. Carte, were called before the curtain at the close. <br><i>London Times of Wednesday, July 1, 1891</i>

<img src="../pics/pixel.gif" width=15 height=1 alt="" border="0">Historic Note: <br>The limited run of <i>Utopia Ltd</i> left Richard Carte with the possibility of an empty theatre during the summer months. As neither Gilbert or Sullivan had anything ready D'Oyly Carte began a search for something new. Andre Messager (1853-1929) had a growing international reputation being looked upon as a second Offenbach in his native France.
However <i>Mirette</i>, in its original form, had the dubious distinction of having the shortest run of any Savoy Opera, lasting only 41 performances. The operetta was revised with the help of lyricist Adrian Ross (1859-1933) and reopened on October 6th. It was more successful and ran for another two months.<br>
Messager didn't establish himself in England until 1904, when his <i>V&eacute;ronique</i> would be successfully produced in London six years after its Paris premiere.<br>
Indeed <i>V&eacute;ronique</i> is rich in the musical style found in the Savoy Operas. There is a highly polished recording available on EMI with the ever delightful Mady Mespl&eacute; in the title role.
