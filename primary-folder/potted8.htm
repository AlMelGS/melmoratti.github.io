<img src="../pics/pixel.gif" width=15 height=1 alt="" border="0">Historic Note: <br>It was Mrs. D'Oyly Carte's intention to revive <i>The Mikado</i> during the 1907 Gilbert and Sullivan season at the Savoy. However after making all the preparations to mount the opera she received a notice form the Lord Chamberlain prohibiting any performances of the work. <i>The Mikado</i> was deemed too offensive to Prince Fushimi who was expected shortly from Japan. This explanation was thought to be ridiculous by the press. However the opera was presented at the Lyceum Theatre in Sheffield in May. The management stated that even though they had read about the ban in the papers he had not been officially advised so had proceeded with the performances.<br>
Anyhow a special correspondent from a leading Japanese newspaper, who was in London in connection with the Price's visit, stated that he had discovered nothing offensive in the Sheffield production which he had travelled down there to witness. Expecting the worst, he had found instead &quot;bright music, much fun and no insults.<br>
On August 24th to mark the close of a memorable season of revivals, the company performed special excerpts from several of the operas, including, much to the surprise of the audience, a scene from <i>The Mikado</i><br>
