<p class="bodytext6" align="center">&quot;From this date, 'First Night'
programmes were often decorated with characters from previous operas&quot;</p>

<p class="bodytext6" align="center">First performed at the Savoy Theatre,
London, on January 22nd, 1887
</p>
<p class="bodytext6">
<A name="potted">The setting is the fishing village of Rederring, in Cornwall.</A>
</p>
<p class="bodytext6"> A bunch of professional bridesmaids are in despair. Their's is the only village in the world
that possesses such a unique group but their services have not been required for six months.
</p>
<p class="bodytext6"> In desperation, one of the group suggests that Rose's aunt, Dame Hannah, could marry. Dame
Hannah revels that, many years ago, she was to have married a handsome youth. But, she discovered,
on the day fixed for their wedding, that he was really Sir Roderic Murgatroyd, one of the bad
Baronets of Ruddigore. She tells the tale of the Witch's curse and how each lord of Ruddigore has to commit a crime every day of his life.
</p>
<p class="bodytext6"> Robin Oakapple, a young Farmer, admires Rose Maybud from afar. He doesn't have the courage to
tell her of his feelings.
</p>
<p class="bodytext6"> Robin's manservant, Old Adam, arrives and reveals to the audience that Robin is in fact Sir
Ruthven Murgatroyd. Twenty years earlier, rather than inheriting the curse, Ruthven had fled his
home and concealed himself in the village.
</p>
<p class="bodytext6"> Robin's foster-brother, the sailor, Richard Dauntless arrives and Robin confesses that he
loves Rose but is too shy to approach her. Richard agrees to plead his case for him. No problem for
the tar who, guided by his heart, is equally attracted to her. However Rose's heart says that she
should give it to Robin.
</p>
<p class="bodytext6"> Robin and Rose go off in one direction and Richard, weeping, goes off in the other.
</p>
<p class="bodytext6"> Enter the wildly dressed Mad Margaret. She is in love with Sir Despard Murgatroyd, the current
inheritor of the witch's curse.
</p>
<p class="bodytext6"> Sir Despard, himself, enters. All flee from him. Although he is doomed to commit a crime every
day, he makes a practice of getting it over early in the morning and spends the rest of the day
doing good.
</p>
<p class="bodytext6"> Richard, still upset that Robin has taken Rose from him, informs Despard that his elder
brother, Ruthven, is alive and living in that very village.
</p>
<p class="bodytext6"> Robin and Rose prepare for their wedding. Sir Despard bursts in and declares that Robin is
really Sir Ruthven Murgatroyd. Rose cannot marry Robin now so pairs off with Richard. Robin falls
senseless on the stage.
</p>
<p class="bodytext6"> Act two is set in the Picture Gallery in Ruddigore Castle.
</p>
<p class="bodytext6"> Robin and Adam are found now dressed for their new roles.
</p>
<p class="bodytext6"> Richard and Rose arrive at the castle to ask Robin's consent, as lord of the manor, to their
marriage. After a while he yields to their pleads.
</p>
<p class="bodytext6"> Left alone Robin begs his ancestors hanging in the picture gallery to have mercy upon him.
Surprise, surprise, the pictures suddenly come to life. The most recently deceased, Sir Roderic, is
spokesman for all of them. Robin details his crimes for the week but his list is most unimpressive.
Roderic orders him to commit the crime of carrying off a lady without delay. The ancestors
disappear back into their frames and Old Adam is despatched to the village to seize a maiden.
</p>
<p class="bodytext6"> Despard, now free of the curse, enters with Margaret. They are dressed in black and both put
in the appearance of respectability. They have been married a week. Despard points out to Robin
that he should be carrying the guilt of all the crimes that had been committed in his name during
the last ten years. Robin decides to defy his ancestors even if it means facing death.
</p>
<p class="bodytext6"> <IMG src="../pics/pixel.gif" width=40 height=1 alt="" border="0">&quot;My eyes are fully open to
my awful situation -
<BR> <IMG src="../pics/pixel.gif" width=40 height=1 alt="" border="0">I shall go at one to Roderic and
make him an oration
<BR> <IMG src="../pics/pixel.gif" width=40 height=1 alt="" border="0">I shall tell him I've recovered
my forgotten moral senses,
<BR> <IMG src="../pics/pixel.gif" width=40 height=1 alt="" border="0">And I don't care
twopence-halfpenny for any consequences.&quot;
</p>
<p class="bodytext6"> Adam bursts in. He has been successful in carrying off a maiden but she turns out to be Dame
Hannah who flies at Robin with a small dagger. Robin pleads to the picture gallery to come back and
help him. Sir Roderic steps from his frame and recognizes Dame Hannah as his childhood sweetheart.
</p>
<p class="bodytext6"> All arrive for the finale. Robin points out to Roderic that a baronet of Ruddigore can die
only by refusing to commit his daily crime and that such a refusal is tantamount to suicide - which
is in itself a crime. So none of the ancestors needed to have died at all.
</p>
<p class="bodytext6"> Robin embraces Rose and Roderic embraces Hannah. All rejoice.</p>

<p class="bodytext6">As the year 1886 drew to it's close <I>The
Golden Legend</I> had musical England by the ears and Sullivan was sought to conduct it whilst at
the same time rehearsing <I>Ruddygore</I> at the Savoy Theatre. The first performance was set back
until January 22nd 1887. A week before this date Sullivan finished the score. On January 19th,
<!--~++++++++++++ LINK12 ++++++++++++~-->

had its last performance and that then left the theatre free for three days of final rehearsals for
<I>Ruddygore</I>.

<p class="bodytext6">The tricky business of bringing the portraits of the ancestors to life and the multiplicity of
costumes and uniforms of the period 1810 made this opera one of the most difficult productions
Gilbert ever attempted. The uniforms of twenty British regiments were represented and Gilbert had
them all inspected for accuracy by Sir Arthur Herbert, Deputy Quartermaster of the British Army.</p>
<p class="bodytext6">One little problem was that of making Sullivan's baton visible when the stage was blacked-out
in Act 2. A glass tube baton containing a platinum wire, which glowed a dull red, was devised.
</p>
<p class="bodytext6">The opening performance went well up until the last twenty minutes when the audience became
restless. At the fall of the curtain the first &quot;boo&quot; in the history of Gilbert and
Sullivan opera was heard from the gallery.
</p>
<p class="bodytext6">The opinion of both the audience and the critics was that the new work was not half as good as

</p>
<p class="bodytext6">Many people took exception to the title.
</p>
<p class="bodytext6">The morning after the production the partners met at Sullivan's flat and made a number of
alterations and excisions. When a play receives a mixed reception on the first night no amount of
editing can make a success of it and the run of <I>Ruddigore</I> only just beat that of

	certainly not too good a part. But first-night nervousness must be condoned, however much it mars

	<DD>&quot;The ghost scene of the second act, representing the descent of the Murgatroyd ancestry
	from their picture frames, of which preliminary notices and hints of the initiated had led one to
	expect much, was a very tame affair. In the first instance, the stage management was not here equal
	to Savoy level. A set of rather ugly daubs... pulled up as you might a patent iron shutter to
	reveal a figure in the recess behind, can scarcely be called a good example of stage contrivance,
	especially when, as on Saturday night, one of these blinds or shutters comes down at an odd moment,

	<DD>&quot;The production of Gilbert and Sullivan's new operetta, <I>Ruddygore</I>, was on Saturday
	evening accompanied by a phenomenon never before experienced at the Savoy Theatre. With the
	rapturous applause of a more than sympathetic first-night audience, which called composer and
	author, Mr. D'Oyly Carte, the manager, and all the principals before the curtain, a small but very
	determined minority mingled its hisses... We have no hesitation in attributing them to the
	feebleness of the second act and the downright stupidity of its d&eacute;nouncement.&quot;

<p class="bodytext6">The day after the opening Gilbert and
Sullivan met to recast the second act. Gilbert rewrote one patter song completely and did a good deal of pruning. In one case the pruning was confusingly incomplete. In the original second act he
had changed Adam's name to the melodramatic 'Gideon Crawle' to go with his master's new wicked
identity. Revising, he cut the verse where the change was introduced but left one reference to
Gideon Crawle, in the dialogue, where it remained for many years and many editions.
</p>
<p class="bodytext6">
The resemblance between the ancestral portraits in Act 2 and the figures that step down from them was an instance where, how thoroughly, things are done at the Savoy. Each character, when his dress had been made and fitted, had a large photograph taken and the painter of the picture took this as his model and copied it.</p>

<p class="bodytext6">After the unparalleled success of
<!--~++++++++++++ LINK21 ++++++++++++~-->
<A href="mikado.htm"><I>The Mikado</I></A>
Gilbert was most anxious to maintain the Savoy standard of achievement and for that purpose he
allowed certain friends to witness the later rehearsals in order that he might benefit by their
criticisms. The company resented the indignity of being taught their business before people they
did not know.
<BR> One day Rutland Barrington gave voice to their discontent, refusing to rehearse before a row
of stalls filled with strangers.
<BR> Gilbert was naturally furious at this public rebuke and the company trembled as he worked off
his emotions in appropriate speech. Eventually he realised that the actors had a reasonable
grievance and the stalls were emptied of their occupants.
<BR> Gilbert did not overlook Barrington's presumption and for several days after the incident he
said to any member of the company who might happen to be watching a rehearsal from the stalls:
<BR> &quot;You mustn't sit here; Barrington won't like it.&quot;
