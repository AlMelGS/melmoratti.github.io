&quot;Why, oh why must (Mad Margaret) be played like a raving, screaming lunatic, whose only place should be the asylum? Margaret is not a mad girl really. She is a distraught girl - a genuine creature of pity, possibly - but a wild maniac she most certainly is not on any possible showing. Love-loneliness - that is her trouble. She is just a sad, solitary figure whose head has been turned crazy, but not demented, by heart-hungary grief. Suggesting her as a wild-eyed gabbling idiot is not only inartistic, but it shows a woeful mis-reading of the spirit of the part.&quot;</font>

&quot;(In) the case of Phoebe in 'The Yeomen of the Guard'. What I hate is that senseless &quot;business&quot; in &quot;Were I thy bride&quot;. You know the what I mean - the scratching of the jailor's chin, the ruffling of his hair, the ogling of the eyes, and all those other &quot;comic&quot; antics which, goodness knows why, are supposed to be &quot;funny&quot;. I think it is wicked that there should be this vulgarity in one of the loveliest of all the songs in the opera. Sit William Gilbert would not have endured it for a moment. He intended that the audience should hear his most beautiful lyric - and they never hear it today.  Sir Arthur Sullivan would not have stood it either. The air he had written was far too sweet to be drowned beneath silly laughter.</font>

&quot;Who, I want to know, intended the Mikado should prance about like a madman, hissing out his lines like a serpent? Never Gilbert! The  very thought would make him turn in his grave. Never poor Dick Temple! The raving monster we so often see now is not one bit like the suave and oily Mikado he created at the Savoy. Temple's Mikado was - as we might put it - &quot;every inch a gentleman&quot;. In his quiet refined way he made you feel that here, despite the grim and sardonic streak inhis nature, was really a fatherly ruler and a &quot;true philantropist&quot;. Who possibly could believe that of present-day Mikados stalking about like a demon with leering eyes and ugly evil grimaces? When Temple sang &quot;My object all sublime&quot; he sang it in a smooth, unforced voice in which every syllable told, and all he did was to clasp and unclasp his hands and smile pleasantly like a kind-hearted despot. When he spoke of &quot;boiling oil&quot; he did not shriek like a fury. The lurid words seemed just to drop off easily from an oily tongue. That was where he was so much an artist. He knew that the real humour was in Gilbert's words, and he had no need to force it out, which is something rarely undestood by the present generation of players.&quot;</font>
