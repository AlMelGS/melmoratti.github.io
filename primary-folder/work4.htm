		By the 1850s Melbourne was said to be one of the richest cities in the world. This was due to the discovery of gold in nearby Ballarat.  By the 1880s Melbourne was a properous thriving centre and that meant that the city needed entertainment. In 1888  Melbourne boasted no 
			less than five very large auditoriums and smaller performances were also staged 
			at venues like the Masonic Hall, the Town-Hall, the Athen&aelig;um Hall, the 
			Victoria Hall and St. George's Hall. These smaller stages were host to a wide 
			variety of comedians, ventriloquists, song recitalists, local dance troupes, 
			bellringers, boxing, wrestling and even a visiting group of Swiss Mountain 
			yodellers. The people of Melbourne were ready to lap up any sort of 
			entertainment and 'Full House' signs were continually posted throughout this 
			period. If audiences began to dwindle then within a matter of days works would 
			be withdrawn, or revamped, in the hope of increasing the box-office. Just as 
			today one is spoilt for choice on the number of movie screens listed in the 
			local paper then in 1880s the same applied to theatrical entertainment.

On Saturday February 14th there was a reappearance by George Rignold this time in Bartley Campbell's romantic drama 'My Partner'. George Rignold originally played the same role in London. &quot;<i>Mr. Rignold's representation of the hero of the drama was an excellent piece of acting.</i>&quot; (Age) &quot;<i>None of the performers displayed any special ability, and the performance met with the disproval of the rowdy portion of the audience.</i>&quot; (Scalfax)

Opening on Saturday March 28th was the first production in Australia of 'Called Back', by Hugh Conway, based on his novel. This play had run for over 250 performances in London. &quot;<i>The authors have achieved much greater success in the performance of their task than might have been anticipated, and the adaptation, which was submitted to the judgement of a colonial audience for the first time on Saturday evening, has the qualities of a successful drama.</i>&quot; (Age).
